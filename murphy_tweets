0	2020-05-24 23:43:08+00:00	We mourn the loss of life in this weekend‘s shootings. Grateful to have worked with the Legislature, law enforcement & civil rights advocates to enact a law ensuring officer-involved shootings are subject to a full, transparent & independent investigation, which is now underway.

6	2020-05-24 16:30:04+00:00	Great run this morning with @FirstLadyNJ, followed by a nice stroll along the boardwalk in Seaside Heights and Seaside Park. Lots of folks wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and responsibly enjoying our beautiful Shore this MDW.
7	2020-05-24 16:17:38+00:00	Hate to break it to you @SenRickScott, but leaving our frontline heroes - educators, cops, health care workers, and firefighters - out to dry is not an option. Direct state aid is about keeping our first responders on the job to do what they do best.
8	2020-05-24 00:32:37+00:00	A heartbreaking milestone: We’ve now lost nearly 100,000 of our fellow Americans to coronavirus. While there are no words we can offer equal to the magnitude of this loss, let us come together to honor their lives by ensuring no one else needlessly dies from this virus.

17	2020-05-23 15:55:44+00:00	A big congratulations to @rubright1rose on graduating from @RowanUniversity – blazing a trail for countless others as the University’s first graduate with Down syndrome. AnnaRose – you define #JerseyStrong. Our entire state celebrates alongside you!
18	2020-05-23 15:37:10+00:00	Congrats to @rasjbaraka and @CityofNewarkNJ for reaching a milestone of over 10,000 lead service lines replaced - over half the total goal of 18,000. Despite #COVID19, Newark has safely kept this project ahead of schedule to ensure access to clean and safe drinking water for all.

20	2020-05-22 19:29:22+00:00	Burning up the phones in support of much-needed direct federal aid to states. It’s the only way to ensure that our first responders, health care workers, and educators stay on the job at a time when they are so desperately needed.
21	2020-05-22 18:12:59+00:00	IMPORTANT: Our @PNCArtsCenter testing site will be CLOSED on Monday, May 25th, in observance of Memorial Day.

26	2020-05-22 15:24:39+00:00	GREAT NEWS: I just got word that my request for an extension of our @fema-partnered testing sites at @BergenCC and @PNCArtsCenter has been ACCEPTED and EXTENDED until the end of June. Capacity of testing at both sites will also be RAISED.
27	2020-05-22 15:21:30+00:00	NEW: Our public colleges and universities will be dividing up a total of $68.8 million in federal CARES Act funds to help cover #COVID19-related expenses. Working with @NJHigherEd, we’re developing a formula to ensure this funding is equitably allocated.
28	2020-05-22 15:19:28+00:00	We remember David Pinto, who was a member of the EMT squad with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority since 1994. He also had served as chief of the Wallington Fire Department, and was a past member of the Wallington Board of Education. We keep him in our thoughts.
29	2020-05-22 15:16:55+00:00	We remember Anthony and Elizabeth Giorgianni, who were better known as Rocky and Betsy, and were married for over 61 years. They always loved the Jersey Shore, and held a deep appreciation for the preciousness of life. May God bless them both.
30	2020-05-22 15:15:46+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 146 members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications, bringing our statewide total to 10,985. Thousands of lives cut short by #COVID19 across our state. This is our family. We all mourn with those left behind.
31	2020-05-22 15:15:21+00:00	Enjoy this weekend, but DO NOT GET COMPLACENT. Keep up with your social distancing. Wear a face covering if you’re going out. Let’s prove that we can keep these trendlines moving in the right direction.
32	2020-05-22 15:14:55+00:00	LOOK: Number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care is now 846 Ventilator use dropped to 674 – nearly half of what it was just two weeks ago 151 new #COVID19 hospitalizations yesterday 259 patients discharged yesterday
33	2020-05-22 15:14:33+00:00	LOOK: Our hospitals currently have 3,049 patients being treated for #COVID19. Our Field Medical Stations reported 43 patients.
34	2020-05-22 15:13:59+00:00	LOOK: The trend rate of new cases at our long-term care facilities continues downward. With the additional help from @DeptVetAffairs, we have faith they'll continue to decline. The numbers of lab-confirmed deaths associated w/ our LTC facilities is also decreasing from the peak.
35	2020-05-22 15:13:02+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 1,394 new positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 152,719. The daily positivity rate for tests from May 18th is 14 percent.
36	2020-05-22 15:12:27+00:00	We're approaching a fiscal cliff. We have two choices: Toss our state into the abyss OR Take measures that will allow us to slowly back away from the edge, and keep our feet on solid ground I know the outcome I prefer. I hope the Legislature and Washington will join us.
37	2020-05-22 15:12:14+00:00	I thank @SpeakerCoughlin for his leadership in posting for a vote legislation that would allow us, as a state, to take advantage of record-low interest rates to get the funding we will need to preserve and protect our vital economic growth and social programs.
38	2020-05-22 15:10:59+00:00	We are NOT ASKING Washington for a bailout. We ARE ASKING for aid to pay our police, fire, and EMS first responders. To keep our public health workers on the job for our recovery. To ensure our kids have the educators they will need come fall.
39	2020-05-22 15:10:34+00:00	We NEED Washington to step up with significant direct fiscal assistance for states. Every day, this becomes a more and more bipartisan endeavor. But, there are just as many minds that remain closed and intractable. One of those closed-minds controls the Senate agenda.
40	2020-05-22 15:09:36+00:00	As we work toward our new September 30th FY2021 state budget deadline, we face an enormous challenge in balancing our wants and needs. Revenue losses we can already project are drastic. We need a series of deliberate and responsible measures in place.
41	2020-05-22 15:09:18+00:00	Today we’re forced to begin making some hard decisions. We’re doing our best to preserve our most-critical investments where we can. We’re proposing a $10 million investment for @NJDeptofHealth for our long-term care facilities.
42	2020-05-22 15:08:44+00:00	I asked the Legislature to authorize state borrowing to ensure we can fund critical government operations. But, we still do not have this authority and therefore we cannot rely on these funds.
43	2020-05-22 15:08:24+00:00	Since March, I’ve made clear that we desperately need federal financial assistance to bridge this fiscal gap. We have not received that.
44	2020-05-22 15:08:13+00:00	I’ve been clear since March that we are facing an unprecedented public health crisis that would soon be followed by a similarly unprecedented fiscal crisis. The hard choices I predicted are now at our doorstep.
45	2020-05-22 15:06:26+00:00	LOOK: We still lead in some indicators in which we would rather not. That is why we will continue down this road RESPONSIBLY and DELIBERATELY.
46	2020-05-22 15:06:11+00:00	LOOK: The key indicators we need to see fall – hospitalizations, numbers of patients in ICU, ventilators in use – have all fallen DRAMATICALLY. Each day brings with it more signs that we’re moving closer to being able to enter Phase 2 of our restart.
47	2020-05-22 15:04:46+00:00	Capacity will also be raised to 25 individuals for: Charter and fishing boats Outdoor batting cages Driving ranges Other outdoor recreational businesses
48	2020-05-22 15:04:12+00:00	BREAKING: I’m signing an EO LIFTING THE LIMIT on outdoor gatherings from 10 to 25 individuals Recreational campgrounds – both public and private – are allowed to reopen, effective IMMEDIATELY. Social distancing must be adhered to. Indoor gatherings remain limited to 10 people.

58	2020-05-21 17:24:50+00:00	Last year, after a bad bicycle accident, Rowdy Meys, of Stockton, was helped by @NJSP Troopers. This year, Rowdy used the money he received on his 11th birthday to buy lunch for all the Troopers at nearby Kingwood Barracks – and was thanked personally by Colonel Pat Callahan.
59	2020-05-21 17:23:50+00:00	Colin and Grace Volpe are both freshmen at Montville Township High School. With their cousins, they formed the “Cousin Crew,” and began raising money to purchase tablets for hospitals and long-term care facilities so patients & residents can see their loved ones across a screen.
60	2020-05-21 17:20:21+00:00	NEW: @NewJerseyDEP has launched the #MaskUpNJ campaign to encourage more New Jerseyans to wear face coverings at New Jersey parks and beaches. Be a model for others. Take part. If you think you look silly wearing a face covering – imagine how silly you’d look in a hospital gown.
61	2020-05-21 17:14:17+00:00	We remember Artemis Nazarian, who was born in Aleppo and came to the U.S. with her family at the age of two. She was the first woman to graduate as an accountant from @BU_Tweets College of Business Administration. May her family find peace in her memory and legacy.
62	2020-05-21 17:11:47+00:00	We remember Lucille Weiss, who spent her career at Springfield’s F.M. Gaudineer middle school, first as a health and physical education educator and then as a guidance counselor. She started a library at the Salvation Army Children’s Home in Acapulco, Mexico. May God bless her.
63	2020-05-21 17:09:51+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 98 members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications, bringing our statewide total to 10,843. No one in this pandemic should ever be seen as just a statistic. These are people. They were our friends and neighbors. They were our family.
64	2020-05-21 17:08:29+00:00	LOOK: Number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care fell to 896 Ventilator use dropped to 700 143 new #COVID19 hospitalizations yesterday 286 patients discharged yesterday

67	2020-05-21 17:06:37+00:00	I had a very good conversation yesterday with @DeptVetAffairs @SecWilkie. VA assistance to our Veteran’s Homes will continue through to the end of June An additional 40 VA clinical staff will be coming to NJ I thank @SecWilkie &amp; @realDonaldTrump for their continued support.
68	2020-05-21 17:06:18+00:00	LOOK: Only Cumberland and Hunterdon counties are seeing rates of doubling under 30 days.

70	2020-05-21 17:05:08+00:00	The team at @NJLaborDept continues to make tremendous progress against unprecedented headwinds. One of those headwinds was created by the prior administration, which CUT staffing levels at the Department by roughly 25 percent – a workforce that we could use now more than ever.
71	2020-05-21 17:04:20+00:00	LOOK: Among our neighbors and other major states, we still lead in some indicators that we would rather not. This is why, while we’re trying to move as quickly as we can, we’re moving as safely as we must.
72	2020-05-21 17:03:56+00:00	LOOK: The key metrics from our hospitals continue to move in the right direction. We’re way down from our peak. Key indicators continue to fall. Each day brings with it surer signs that we’re moving closer to being able to enter Phase 2 of our economic restart.
73	2020-05-21 17:02:57+00:00	To all New Jerseyans still out of work: We are 100% committed to getting you the support you need. Every New Jerseyan who has applied for unemployment benefits will receive them.

77	2020-05-20 20:51:34+00:00	There’s a special place in hell for people spreading fear, not facts, during this pandemic. The @NJOHSP and @ReadyNJ are working hard to dispel rumors and misinformation during this crisis. I urge ALL New Jerseyans to stay informed by visiting http://njohsp.gov/covid19.
78	2020-05-20 20:16:27+00:00	My big fear is that people will die needlessly because politicians are rushing a reopening contrary to public health guidance and data.
79	2020-05-20 17:44:40+00:00	Congrats to @Princeton_Prize in Race Relations winners Darlene Folas and Calvin Bell III, and the many students across NJ who were honored for their tremendous work! Our diversity is what makes NJ great, and it's deeply gratifying to see our youngest minds work to promote equity.

But, we all still have a lot of work to do. We can’t move forward unless we’re confident that doing so won’t move us backward. Let’s keep it up.
85	2020-05-20 17:21:43+00:00	I know the news likes to highlight those who want to be examples of defiance, but we know the overwhelming majority of you understand this battle we’re waging. A huge THANK YOU to everyone who keeps doing the things we need to be doing to get through this.
86	2020-05-20 17:20:28+00:00	“NJ Sews in Unity” in Westfield has brought together a host of sewers, cutters, and organizers from across Union and Somerset counties. They’ve donated more than 7,500 hand-sewn masks, 120 gowns, and more than 570 other items. #NJThanksYou!
87	2020-05-20 17:17:38+00:00	We remember Carol Ann Lockett, a dedicated and popular crossing guard for the Elizabeth Police Department who was locally famous as “the unofficial Mayor of Elizabeth.” We will remember her, and keep her and her family in our thoughts and prayers.
88	2020-05-20 17:15:56+00:00	We remember William Shuler, a lifelong resident of Dover. He was a founding member of what is now the Dover Area Little League and served on the Dover Board of Education for 52 years. Bill was a constant presence in his family’s life. May God bless him.
89	2020-05-20 17:14:21+00:00	We remember Raúl Alberto Solórzano Guillén. His story is the American story – born in Nicaragua, he came to the U.S. in search of a better life. For 33 years, he worked in the linen-cleaning industry. Raúl loved tango music, and he had lots of friends. May God bless him.
90	2020-05-20 17:12:59+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 168 members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications, bringing our statewide total to 10,747. No one deserves to be relegated to a statistic. We’re one family. We rise and fall as one. We celebrate and mourn as one, too.

96	2020-05-20 17:06:47+00:00	A strong testing program is one of the foundational principles for our Road Back. More testing = more people will know their health status. More people knowing their health status = more peace of mind. More testing = more data. More data = more steps forward.
97	2020-05-20 17:05:56+00:00	NEW: Beginning 5/22, New Jerseyans will be able to take a self-administered, self-swab #COVID19 test at seven @Walmart locations across our state: Drive-up locations 7AM – 9PM Three days a week Weather permitting By appointment only Learn more: http://MyQuestCOVIDTest.com

108	2020-05-19 17:23:50+00:00	We remember Assemblyman Paul McCurrie and Delores McCurrie, who were married for more than 60 years and passed within days of each other. We keep Paul and Liz in our thoughts and prayers. May God bless them both.
109	2020-05-19 17:22:02+00:00	We remember Donnie Nickelson-Barret, who served at the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office for 33 years.

110	2020-05-19 17:21:27+00:00	Public health creates economic health. Data determines dates. Only you can determine both.
111	2020-05-19 17:20:18+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 162 members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications. Our statewide total now stands at 10,586. For them, our flags remain at half-staff. As a state, we can ensure that these lives are not forgotten.
112	2020-05-19 17:19:17+00:00	LOOK: We’re not out of the woods yet. Our standing in comparison to our neighboring states is improving, but we have much more work to do together. Keep it up.
113	2020-05-19 17:18:09+00:00	LOOK: The metrics in our hospitals are DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY since their peak. Across the board, key numbers are down by half – if not way more than half. Seeing these trends is critical.
114	2020-05-19 17:17:24+00:00	This is no time for anyone to be spiking any footballs or patting anyone on the back. Those things wouldn’t comport with social distancing, anyway. This is a time for us to double-down. Let’s keep it up.
115	2020-05-19 17:16:54+00:00	The only surefire cure available right now for #COVID19? To not get it. Maintain social distancing Wear a face covering Practice safe hygiene

118	2020-05-19 17:10:44+00:00	LOOK: The rate of new cases at our long-term care facilities has decreased from its peak. We continue to work hard to push this curve even lower. The numbers of lab-confirmed deaths associated with our long-term care facilities shows a decrease from its peak.

This #EMSWeek, our emergency responders are serving on the front lines of #COVID19, making the difference between life and death. No one better represents the resiliency of New Jersey. We cannot thank them enough.

136	2020-05-18 17:35:49+00:00	This isn’t going to be quick. We’re going to move deliberately based on data. We have to move forward based on the facts. Together, we’ll get to the end of this journey stronger and fairer than ever.
137	2020-05-18 17:35:35+00:00	I want to say THANK YOU to the millions of you who are the reason we can move forward with our plans. It’s because of YOU that the curves have flattened. I know we can continue to rely on you to flatten them even further as we begin our restart.

142	2020-05-18 17:31:51+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 83 members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications. Our statewide total is now 10,435. We cannot let those we have lost ever just become a statistic. We must remember their names, their faces, their families &amp; the lives they led.
143	2020-05-18 17:30:52+00:00	LOOK: Number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care fell to 1,053 Ventilator use dropped to 819 334 new #COVID19 hospitalizations yesterday 190 discharges yesterday

145	2020-05-18 17:28:39+00:00	LOOK: The rate of new cases at our long-term care facilities has decreased. We’ve been working hard toward this. While an out-sized proportion of our statewide #COVID19 deaths are related to our long-term care facilities, we also see the 7-day average showing a SLOWING rate.
146	2020-05-18 17:26:27+00:00	LOOK: Practically the entire state is now the lightest shade on this map – meaning the rate of doubling is now more than 30 days in all but Cumberland county.
147	2020-05-18 17:23:50+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 1,735 new positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 148,039. Our curve continues to move in the right direction overall. The daily positivity rate for tests from May 14th was 12 percent.
148	2020-05-18 17:22:52+00:00	This is New Jersey. We’ve risen to every challenge thrown our way since our very founding. We’ve always – always – rolled with the punches and punched above our weight. Now is our time to shine.
149	2020-05-18 17:22:46+00:00	I’m confident that we will be able to pass each test and move through the subsequent stages. We are managing today and planning for tomorrow.
150	2020-05-18 17:22:35+00:00	We will get through this. We’re already on our way. Six weeks ago, when I was asked whether there would even be a summer at the Shore, I was optimistic but unsure. Now, we have the plans in place and we know we will have a summer.
151	2020-05-18 17:22:15+00:00	We need you to: Wear a face covering in public Wash your hands Keep your distance
152	2020-05-18 17:21:40+00:00	#COVID19 has changed everything. After 9/11, new security measures were put into place that we were not accustomed to. Those practices are now part of our routines. The aftermath of #COVID19 will be similar. Social distancing will still be the rule of the days ahead.
153	2020-05-18 17:21:16+00:00	We WILL NOT risk lives to a rebound of #COVID19. We will get to the new normal by ensuring: Social distancing Proper sanitation and hygiene Face coverings A strong program of testing and contact tracing Personal responsibility and compliance
154	2020-05-18 17:20:50+00:00	Along all these stages, as our workers return to their traditional places of work, we’re working on supporting: Resumption of child-care services Scaling up @NJTRANSIT
155	2020-05-18 17:20:16+00:00	STAGE 3: This will depend on progress continuing from Stage 2. This will include: -Allowing shoppers to once again enter downtown and main street storefronts -Limited gatherings with appropriate safeguards
156	2020-05-18 17:19:07+00:00	STAGE 2: This is where we’re working to get to now. A broader restart of our economy. This includes: -Expanded retail -Outdoor dining -Limited personal care -Museums -Libraries
157	2020-05-18 17:16:40+00:00	STAGE 1: This is where we we are now. We’re opening up businesses in a way that still provides maximum protection for residents. We’ve reopened our parks and put in place plans to have our beaches and lakefronts open – with social distancing guidelines in place.
158	2020-05-18 17:16:17+00:00	STAGE 0: This is where we were essentially stuck at the height of the pandemic. Our state was locked down as much as we could while ensuring access to essential services and stores. Today, we find ourselves in a better place because the steps we took have been effective.
159	2020-05-18 17:15:46+00:00	As we enter each stage, we will allow businesses and activities to reopen according to their risk level and the challenges they will face to safeguard public health. We will aim to move through each stage as quickly as we can, but with public health firmly in mind.
160	2020-05-18 17:13:08+00:00	Until a proven vaccine is widely available, we cannot firmly enter the “new normal,” when life will once again return to all our workplaces, downtowns, and main streets.
161	2020-05-18 17:10:20+00:00	Our goal is to protect our workforce. 60 percent of our workforce is engaged in a significant amount of contact to co-workers and the public. We’re putting a premium on ensuring workplace safeguards that will protect you, your co-workers, and your customers and clients.
162	2020-05-18 17:09:21+00:00	We will move through STAGES toward our new normal. Our singular goal will be to prevent another attack by #COVID19. We will be guided by public health, data, and science.
163	2020-05-18 17:06:49+00:00	LOOK: We’re not nearly out of the woods yet – but we’re moving forward, carefully, methodically, and responsibly. Together, we’re moving toward what we must all acknowledge will be a “new normal.”
164	2020-05-18 17:05:26+00:00	We’ve seen all the important metrics we need to see in our hospitals: Number of patients being treated for #COVID19 is down significantly Number of people entering our hospitals is down significantly Fewer ICU beds are being filled Fewer ventilators are in use
165	2020-05-18 17:03:59+00:00	We’re now comfortable allowing golfers to tee-off in foursomes, as opposed to in pairs.
166	2020-05-18 17:03:46+00:00	BREAKING: Today I will sign an Executive Order allowing some additional outdoor recreational areas and businesses to restart their operations – effective 5/22: Batting cages Golf ranges Shooting &amp; archery ranges Horseback riding Private tennis clubs Community gardens

268	2020-05-13 17:33:56+00:00	These numbers are a sobering reminder that the #COVID impact is not limited to the health of our people, but also to the health of our state’s finances. This makes direct assistance from the federal government all the more necessary and all the more urgent.
269	2020-05-13 17:33:56+00:00	April revenue collections have declined nearly 60 percent as compared to last April – an unprecedented $3.5 billion. These numbers reflect a lot of economic activity from March – including the weeks before we began the systematic shuttering of our greater economy.
270	2020-05-13 17:24:18+00:00	Donte Patterson, a participant in @HomeFront's Hire Expectations jobs-training program, recently celebrated his 25th bday in quarantine with his wife and baby daughter by becoming a H.S. graduate. He wasn't going to let #COVID19 keep him from graduating. Congratulations, Donte!
271	2020-05-13 17:23:49+00:00	Catholic Charities in Paterson sent us this photo of individuals they serve in their Dept for Persons with Disabilities: “We are all in this together, so please stay home and help us stop the spread.” To Chris and the entire team – and to everyone you serve: #NJThanksYou
272	2020-05-13 17:21:11+00:00	We remember Jerome Rice, of Elizabeth, a former @USMC Sergeant and @Mountainside_pd Detective Sergeant. He leaves behind his wife, Audrey, their 5 children, 21 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Jerry was an American hero. May God bless him and his family.
273	2020-05-13 17:19:33+00:00	"We remember Betty ""Belle"" Lou Adams Dalesandro, of Plainfield, a nurse who spent over 25 yrs at the Lyons Veterans Hospital. Belle leaves her husband of 62 years, four children, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. We keep her and her family in our thoughts today."
274	2020-05-13 17:17:33+00:00	We remember Cathy Coughlin, of Glen Ridge, a devoted daughter, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend. Her family asked me to extend their gratitude to the staff at @sjh_nj for their care and compassion during her final hours. May God bless her, and all who loved her.
275	2020-05-13 17:16:58+00:00	Sadly, today we report another 197 deaths from COVID-19 complications. Our statewide total now stands at 9,702. Together, we mourn each of these losses, members of our New Jersey family, and our hearts are with their friends and loved ones.
276	2020-05-13 17:16:13+00:00	LOOK: The number of patients reported in critical or intensive care fell to 1,226. Ventilator use dropped to 928. There were 364 new COVID-19 hospitalizations yesterday. The number of discharges went up considerably yesterday, to 382.
277	2020-05-13 17:15:34+00:00	LOOK: At our long-term care facilities, here are the numbers of positive cases and deaths. We are hopeful that we may be seeing the leveling off of these numbers, as they have slowed.
278	2020-05-13 17:14:37+00:00	LOOK: The number of patients currently being treated in hospitals is 4,226 and the overall trendline reflects our steady progress. Our Field Medical Stations again reported 34 patients.
279	2020-05-13 17:13:49+00:00	LOOK: The map that we have been regularly turning to keeps showing slower rates of spread across the state.
280	2020-05-13 17:13:00+00:00	LOOK: Yesterday, we received an additional 1,028 positive test results, for a current statewide total of 141,560. Here are the trend lines that you have helped create through social distancing. The “daily positivity” or “spot positivity” rates continue to flow downward.
281	2020-05-13 17:10:42+00:00	The success we’ve had flattening the curve gives us confidence that we’ll be able to announce the end of more restrictions in the days and weeks ahead. There is no light switch we can flip – we can only slowly raise the dimmer.
282	2020-05-13 17:10:06+00:00	Over the coming days and weeks, we'll be able to take more steps. We’re moving slowly and deliberately because any misstep risks further outbreaks. When public health tells us it is safe to remove a restriction, we’ll remove it. Not a moment before. Not a moment after.
283	2020-05-13 17:09:50+00:00	Today, we are able to take these steps to get us on the road back thanks to The work YOU have done taking social distancing to heart, and made it part of your daily routines. Expanded and accessible testing programs Implementation of a robust contact tracing program
284	2020-05-13 17:08:59+00:00	NEW: Gatherings of vehicles, such as drive-in movies or church services, are not a violation of my order prohibiting mass gatherings, as long as all participants remain in cars. If vehicles are closer than six ft apart, all windows, sunroofs, convertible tops must remain closed.
285	2020-05-13 17:08:10+00:00	NEW: At our non-essential retail stores: No customers will be allowed inside retail stores Stores can open for curbside pickup only
286	2020-05-13 17:07:44+00:00	NEW: At our construction sites, work can resume with sensible safeguards in place: Clear posting of safety protocols Preventing overcrowding Prohibiting non-essential visitors Staggering work hours and breaks Ensuring proper sanitation
287	2020-05-13 17:07:12+00:00	LOOK: We are not out of the woods yet. When compared to other states, we see that New Jersey still bears a significant burden from COVID-19 So, keeping up with social distancing is essential as we move forward.
288	2020-05-13 17:06:33+00:00	DATA DETERMINES DATES. The data we are seeing gives us confidence that we can begin the restart of our economy – to get people back to work, and set the stage for the steps to come.
289	2020-05-13 17:05:17+00:00	LOOK: Let’s not forget where we were only six weeks ago, when we first shared our worst-case projections. We were preparing for upward of 36,000 hospitalizations, 9,000 New Jerseyans in the ICUs and 7,500 on ventilators. Because of your hard work, reality never came close.
290	2020-05-13 17:04:15+00:00	Data shows that we are ready to begin to restart our economy. From the peak: New hospitalizations down 2/3 Total hospitalizations down nearly 1/2 Patients in ICU are down Patients on ventilators down Positive cases down nearly 70% Deaths have decreased more than 1/3
291	2020-05-13 17:03:08+00:00	Today, I will sign an Executive Order, effective 6:00 AM Monday, May 18, 2020: Allow the restart of non-essential construction Allow non-essential retail stores to reopen for curbside pickup only Permit drive-through and drive-in events under social distancing guidelines

305	2020-05-12 17:32:35+00:00	When John Von Sternberg was 18, he joined the Mountain Lakes Volunteer Fire Department, and called the firehouse home from that point on. He was a veteran of the @NJNationalGuard and will be remembered for his great generosity and sense of service.
306	2020-05-12 17:32:16+00:00	Ruth Pringle worked at the legendary Bell Labs, where she met her future husband, Mac. Ruth loved the outdoors and went back to school to study geology. She was a fixture in many clubs in her hometown, and at the First Presbyterian Church of Cranford. May God bless her.
307	2020-05-12 17:31:57+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost 198 more New Jerseyans to #COVID19. We’ve now lost 9,508 blessed souls to this virus. In their honor, we will battle this virus and win.
308	2020-05-12 17:31:44+00:00	Yesterday there were 360 new #COVID19 hospitalizations and 164 live discharges.
309	2020-05-12 17:31:17+00:00	LOOK: The number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care increased by 51 over Sunday to 1,306 Ventilator use currently stands at 982 – an increase by 12 from Sunday
310	2020-05-12 17:31:07+00:00	Holding a COVID-19 briefing. WATCH:
311	2020-05-12 17:30:42+00:00	The number of positive cases and deaths connected to our long-term care facilities continues to grow, but that rate has slowed.
312	2020-05-12 17:30:12+00:00	The number of patients currently being treated for #COVID19 increased by roughly 130 yesterday – now standing at 4,328. The overall trendiness are still showing progress.
313	2020-05-12 17:29:53+00:00	LOOK: We continue to see SLOWER rates of spread across the state.
314	2020-05-12 17:29:31+00:00	LOOK: We’re seeing real progress in declining positivity rates. The spot positivity rate for tests from May 8th is 23 percent.
315	2020-05-12 17:28:54+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 898 new positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 140,743.
316	2020-05-12 17:26:49+00:00	Public health creates economic health. We’re expanding access to testing and putting together a robust tracing effort to give us faith that the public’s health will continue to be priority number one. Without that faith, there can be no economic restart or recovery.
317	2020-05-12 17:26:15+00:00	This will take the investment of significant state resources, federal resources, and investments by our philanthropic and corporate partners. This is where the announced partnership of @MikeBloomberg for a regional approach to contact tracing will be so very welcome.
318	2020-05-12 17:25:05+00:00	This will not be cheap. Maintaining both a steady supply of testing materials and a community of contact tracers will take hundreds of millions of dollars. We all must understand that.
319	2020-05-12 17:24:31+00:00	Testing and contact tracing are truly the underpinnings of the Road Back. Until there’s a proven vaccine, our best chance at catching and containing #COVID19 is through testing and contact tracing.
320	2020-05-12 17:21:40+00:00	We know we’ll need to further grow the ranks of contact tracers and create jobs for New Jerseyans. If you’re interested in becoming a contact tracer, please visit http://covid19.nj.gov/tracer.
321	2020-05-12 17:21:29+00:00	.@NJDeptofHealth will soon sign a memorandum of understanding with @RutgersSPH to stand up the first group of our new contact-tracing workforce.
322	2020-05-12 17:21:22+00:00	We'll build a strong corps of community contact tracers. We currently have 800-900 tracers statewide. We'll need at least 1,000. We’re partnering with our state’s colleges & universities to employ their public health, social work, and related students as our front-line workers.
323	2020-05-12 17:20:50+00:00	We’re increasing collaboration among municipalities that make up a county to help have a more regional/county based approach.
324	2020-05-12 17:20:42+00:00	We’re contracting with the technology firm @dimagi to bring their CommCare platform to New Jersey. CommCare will ensure that all data is centralized and uniformly reported.
325	2020-05-12 17:20:35+00:00	Contact tracing has remained largely a local or regional effort. We must now centralize these efforts. I will execute an executive order to ensure that local heath departments, and state health officials, are all using and working off of the same information platform.
326	2020-05-12 17:20:28+00:00	 CONTACT TRACING We’re going to have to use contact tracing unlike it’s ever been deployed before. We’re going to need to build our Community Contact Tracing Corps – an entire community of contact tracers to help those already on the ground.
327	2020-05-12 17:19:57+00:00	We will be guided by data, not by politics. We must. #COVID19 doesn’t care whether you live in a blue home or red home, or a home of no color at all.
328	2020-05-12 17:19:51+00:00	As we get testing supplies, we will deploy them to areas based on need and where potential hotspots may be emerging, to ensure we hold off a second wave.
329	2020-05-12 17:19:05+00:00	Expanding our testing capabilities will demand continued strong partnerships with: Our federal partners Private labs @RutgersU RUCDR Infinite Biologics
330	2020-05-12 17:18:24+00:00	Our testing plan will also utilize mobile testing units which will go right into our communities. We will also open testing sites within our institutions of faith, including at churches and mosques. We will work with all our communities of faith to build trust.
331	2020-05-12 17:18:16+00:00	.@NJDeptofHealth will be issuing a standing order expanding access to testing without a prescription for residents with possible exposure who fall in priority categories and lack access to a primary care practitioner. This is particularly important for our communities of colors.
332	2020-05-12 17:18:10+00:00	We need a program that gives every New Jerseyan the confidence that they can be tested, as well – whether they’re symptomatic or asymptomatic, or whether they work in the public or private sectors.
333	2020-05-12 17:17:18+00:00	 All long-term care facilities must confirm to @NJDeptofHealth that they have updated their outbreak prevention plans to meet this directive no later than May 19th
334	2020-05-12 17:17:18+00:00	We need a testing program that ensures access for members of vulnerable populations. @NJDeptofHealth will issue a directive requiring: All residents &amp; staff at our long-term care facilities be tested no later than May 26th – with follow-up testing not more than one week later
335	2020-05-12 17:16:58+00:00	We need a robust testing program that is engrained throughout our communities and goes out to the people: Vulnerable populations Frontline workers – health workers, first responders, transit workers, and food service workers General population
336	2020-05-12 17:15:04+00:00	As of today, there are 135 testing sites – both public and privately operated – across our state. 11 @riteaid testing locations recently went online. @cvspharmacy will have swab-and-send testing capabilities in place at 50 of its stores across the state by the end of the month.
337	2020-05-12 17:14:56+00:00	We’re continuing to ramp up our testing capacity and testing sites. More testing means more people will know their health status. That means more peace of mind. More testing creates more data. More data allows us to take more steps forward.
338	2020-05-12 17:11:57+00:00	 TESTING We’re now well on our way to our next goal of being able to provide at least 20,000 tests a day by the end of the month. March: 6,000 tests a day April: 12,000 tests a day End of May: 20,000 tests of day End of June: At least 25,000 tests a day
339	2020-05-12 17:08:41+00:00	But LOOK at the numbers of #COVID19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for every 100,000 New Jerseyans. We can make a strong case that no state is currently as impacted as ours. There are still thousands in our hospitals. More will die. We know this. We cannot forget this.
340	2020-05-12 17:05:53+00:00	Over the past two weeks, we’ve seen the trendlines that we’ve needed to see. The multiple stresses on our hospitals have been consistently – and in some cases dramatically – lessening.
341	2020-05-12 17:04:20+00:00	The Road Back is paved with five words: Public health creates economic health. Getting on the Road Back begins by reaching benchmarks and data milestones. To stay on the Road Back, we need to expand testing capacity and implement robust contact tracing.

355	2020-05-11 17:37:39+00:00	Born and raised in the Philippines, Felicisimo Omaña Luna Jr. came to the U.S. in 1986. In 2016, he earned his bachelor’s degree in Nursing. He was one of our front-line heroes at @TrinitasRMedCtr. We thank him for his years of service to the people in his care.
356	2020-05-11 17:36:31+00:00	Mary Jean McLaughlin was a teacher for over 30 years, and continued to substitute teach for several years after she retired in 2007. She passed on National Teacher Day. May God bless her and her family.
357	2020-05-11 17:35:00+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost 59 more New Jerseyans to #COVID19. We've now lost 9,310 members of our New Jersey family to this virus. If we start on the road back too quickly, we know we will lose many more lives than we need to – and we’ve already lost 9,310 precious souls.
358	2020-05-11 17:32:29+00:00	There were 179 new #COVID19 hospitalizations yesterday, and 389 across the weekend. 227 live patients were discharged yesterday, and 666 across both Saturday and Sunday.
359	2020-05-11 17:32:18+00:00	LOOK: 1,255 patients are currently in either critical or intensive care continues to fall – this number continues to fall 970 ventilators are currently in use – the SECOND STRAIGHT DAY of ventilator count being under 1,000.
360	2020-05-11 17:31:43+00:00	The numbers of positive cases and deaths connected to our long-term care facilities continues to grow. We’re continuing to work hard to mitigate these numbers. We had good reports from this past weekend, when the first group of @NJNationalGuard members joined several facilities.
361	2020-05-11 17:30:58+00:00	LOOK: The number of patients currently being treated for #COVID19 in our hospitals has dropped to 4,195. The number of hospitalizations across our health care systems, regionally, also continues to trend down.
362	2020-05-11 17:30:41+00:00	The rate of spread continues to SLOW across the state.
363	2020-05-11 17:30:13+00:00	LOOK: We’re seeing real progress in declining positivity rates. The spot positivity rate for tests from May 7th – the last day for which we have complete data – is 26 percent.
364	2020-05-11 17:29:43+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 1,453 new positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 139,945.
365	2020-05-11 17:10:02+00:00	A fiscal disaster is not months away – hard decisions will be on our doorstep in just a few weeks. Time is of the essence, and Congress needs to act NOW. This fight is not over, and I will do everything I can to see that it is won.
366	2020-05-11 17:09:14+00:00	Our administration is tackling New Jersey’s legacy fiscal issues. Yet, all some in Washington can hear are the noises from our past. They’re all the happier to lay the sins of those who created this mess at the feet of those trying to fix it.
367	2020-05-11 17:08:25+00:00	No one has asked for a bailout. We’re asking for the ability to prevent this public health emergency from turning into a second Great Depression. We’re asking for help to keep first responders, front-line workers, and educators from having to fear for their jobs.
368	2020-05-11 17:08:14+00:00	Some have suggested that our states should just go bankrupt. The message today – “Washington to States: Drop Dead.”
369	2020-05-11 17:07:50+00:00	Some have suggested that it’s the fault of the states that #COVID19 has ravaged us. Forget the fact that we have lost more than 9,000 New Jerseyans to this illness. Forget the fact that we have had to shutter our economy to try to save lives.
370	2020-05-11 17:07:20+00:00	Kentucky gets back $2.41 back for every dollar it gets from taxpayers – including ours. @senatemajldr – Good luck tapping New Jersey for your next project in Kentucky if New Jersey has nothing to give because you refused to help us restart and recover.
371	2020-05-11 17:07:01+00:00	Some leaders in Washington, like @senatemajldr, are all too happy to spend the tax dollars of New Jerseyans on pork projects back home. But right now, they seemingly have no interest in helping states like New Jersey avert a national economic catastrophe.
372	2020-05-11 17:05:32+00:00	.@SenatorMenendez is sponsoring legislation with @SenBillCassidy that would deliver $500 billion to state &amp; local govts across the nation to ensure the delivery of essential services, like police and educators. Thank you, @SenatorMenendez, for your tenacity in making our case.
373	2020-05-11 17:05:14+00:00	I’ve been pressing the case for direct state assistance by working with: @SenatorMenendez Our Regional Congressional #COVID19 Task Force – led by @RepSherrill and @RepPeteKing @GovLarryHogan
374	2020-05-11 17:03:52+00:00	Direct aid to states is an incredibly pressing issue. It's increasingly one that knows no political party. It’s an issue that is uniting both Democrats & Republicans. I’m proud to have been among the first governors to sound the alarm for the need for direct federal assistance.

397	2020-05-09 17:16:58+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 166 New Jerseyans to #COVID19, bringing our statewide total to 9,116. These lives should never be just a number. They were real people, who lived real lives, and who leave behind real families. They were each a treasured part of our New Jersey family.

401	2020-05-09 17:12:59+00:00	The number of positive cases and deaths connected to our long-term care facilities continues to grow.

422	2020-05-08 17:30:40+00:00	It is our solemn duty to uphold the legacy of the Greatest Generation, which fought valiantly to preserve the freedom of hundreds of millions to live up to. As our Greatest Generation slips from us, we cannot let the lessons they taught us slip away with them.
423	2020-05-08 17:30:33+00:00	Words matter. When the word “fascism” is raised and Nazi slogans are used by people who claim to be patriotic Americans to protest against freely elected leaders – whether here or elsewhere across the nation – it should give us pause.
424	2020-05-08 17:30:22+00:00	This is an entirely disgusting false equivalence. It is ignorant and repugnant. Tens of millions were killed by fascism and its megalomaniacal leaders – 20 million soldiers, 6 million Jews, millions of others in the death camps, and untold millions of civilians.
425	2020-05-08 17:30:22+00:00	Today, those words sometimes appear to be fading. Especially now, some misguided people are taking to calling the necessary efforts we have undertaken to save lives from #COVID19, “fascism.” We've seen other freely elected leaders demeaned and depicted as Hitler himself.
426	2020-05-08 17:30:21+00:00	75 years ago, on #VEDay, some of the greatest horrors the world has ever known were exposed – the depth and breadth of the Holocaust and the depravity of fascism. The world vowed, “Never again.”

429	2020-05-08 17:24:33+00:00	Social distancing is all we have to save lives. We’re saving them. But, we need to save more. Keep practicing your social distancing. Keep wearing a face covering when out in public.
430	2020-05-08 17:23:53+00:00	We’ve now lost more than 9,000 of our fellow New Jerseyans. In all of World War II, we only lost 12,600. We know we know we will lose more, but how many – and whether we mark another solemn milestone we do not wish to pass – is up to us.
431	2020-05-08 17:22:54+00:00	Born and raised in Cuba, Asela Gejo, her husband, and four children came to the U.S. in 1962, to escape communism. She worked as a teacher’s aide in Asbury Park.

434	2020-05-08 17:19:10+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost 162 more New Jerseyans to #COVID19. We’ve now lost 8,952 members of our New Jersey family to this virus. We cannot think of the toll of COVID-19 only in economic terms, but also in its most basic human terms.
435	2020-05-08 17:18:42+00:00	Cannot overstate this enough: Our hospital systems are still dealing with far more patients than they would be otherwise in any other year. The stress on our health care system, while certainly lessening, is still there. We have the power to push these numbers down further.
436	2020-05-08 17:15:59+00:00	LOOK: The number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care continues to decrease – currently standing at 1,439 Ventilator use also continues to decline – currently standing at 1,089

438	2020-05-08 17:15:00+00:00	This NOT a sign that we can, or will, relax our vigilance. It is a sign that the work we all have been doing so far to slow the spread of #COVID19, and to reduce the numbers of patients in our hospitals, are working.
439	2020-05-08 17:14:18+00:00	IMPORTANT: Our Field Medical Station at the Meadowlands Expo Center will stand-down over the weekend. Its operations will transfer to the East Orange General Hospital site, which just completed construction.
440	2020-05-08 17:14:11+00:00	As of last night, there are currently 4,605 #COVID19 patients in our hospitals. This is a decrease of 1,000 from last Friday.
441	2020-05-08 17:13:37+00:00	Rates of spread are SLOWING across the state. This is a very positive sign.

445	2020-05-08 17:09:58+00:00	We ask asymptomatic individuals to try and contact a health care provider before seeking testing, as it is critical that testing is available for our front-line workers and vulnerable populations.
446	2020-05-08 17:09:37+00:00	BREAKING: Our #COVID19 testing sites at @BergenCC and @PNCArtsCenter will now provide tests to ASYMPTOMATIC New Jersey residents. Expanded access to testing is one of our key principles for getting New Jersey on the road back to restart and recovery.

448	2020-05-08 17:08:43+00:00	Our Advisory Council will help us: Gather the local intelligence we need to get our economy running again Create the framework for coping with our new long-term economic realities
449	2020-05-08 17:08:33+00:00	We understand that we need a smart and granular approach to recovery. Reopening the restaurants and boardwalk shops down the Shore is far different from restarting retail in downtown Morristown, Lambertville, or Collingswood, or anywhere else.
450	2020-05-08 17:08:23+00:00	Our Advisory Council will break into nine committees: Facilities and Construction Government Health Care Main Street Manufacturing and Supply Chain Professional Services Social Services and Faith Tourism and Entertainment Transportation and Infrastructure
451	2020-05-08 17:06:11+00:00	BREAKING: I’m signing an EO to create the Governor’s Restart and Recovery Advisory Council – bringing together leaders from various industry, community, and faith-based groups and institutions across our state to work in conjunction with our Restart and Recovery Commission.

453	2020-05-08 15:30:35+00:00	75 years ago, good triumphed over evil due to the sacrifices of so many. In honor of the 75th anniversary of #VEDay, I’ve ordered that all U.S. and New Jersey flags be flown at half-staff today at all state buildings.
454	2020-05-08 15:03:45+00:00	Great chat yesterday with @PeterHamby on how our state is battling #COVID19 – and how we will win. Look out for the episodes starting Monday on @GoodLuckAmerica @Snapchat.
455	2020-05-08 13:46:43+00:00	As we celebrate our extraordinary AAPI communities, we must confront a rising tide of racism and xenophobia. Our diversity is our greatest strength, and we will continue to fight for equality and opportunity for AAPIs today and for generations to come. #AAPIHM
456	2020-05-08 13:46:42+00:00	This #AAPIHM, we celebrate the rich heritage of our Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. In New Jersey, we’re proud to be home to the fourth largest AAPI community in the nation.

463	2020-05-07 17:30:40+00:00	Getting through this is going to take teamwork. It’s going to take compassion. It’s going to take focus. All three are among our strong New Jersey values. We’re getting there. If we lean in on these values, there’s nothing we can’t beat.
464	2020-05-07 17:30:00+00:00	Shannon King and Kris Parker started their own pantry to support the students they worked with every day. They received enough donations to supply 200 food baskets and have expanded their effort to include a weekly hot meal. #NJThanksYou!

468	2020-05-07 17:24:05+00:00	Dr. Satyender Dev Khanna and Dr. Priya Khanna were father and daughter. They both dedicated their lives to helping others. This is a family dedicated to health and medicine. Our words cannot amply express our condolences.
469	2020-05-07 17:21:18+00:00	Alhaji Allie Kamara was active in many community, social, political and cultural organizations, and was a past president of the New Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Leonean group All People’s Congress. We wish his family peace at this trying time.
470	2020-05-07 17:19:04+00:00	Howard Arnesen Jr. was the longtime owner of the “First Place” baseball card store that stood in downtown Cranford. He was a sports enthusiast, coaching for the Cranford Little League in the 1960s and 1970s. May God bless him and his family.
471	2020-05-07 17:17:50+00:00	Even with the positive news from our hospitals, there are still families and communities who are grieving the loss of more members our collective family. We’ve lost 254 more New Jerseyans to this virus, bringing our statewide total to 8,801.
472	2020-05-07 17:17:26+00:00	Data determines dates.
473	2020-05-07 17:17:03+00:00	Public health creates economic health.
474	2020-05-07 17:16:45+00:00	Our numbers continue to move in the right direction. But, we cannot lull ourselves into thinking that all is well. We’re still in the midst of a public health emergency. These numbers are still far above what they would be in “normal times.”
475	2020-05-07 17:15:52+00:00	LOOK: We can see these numbers broken down by region. South Jersey remains where we see more people heading into the hospital than leaving.
476	2020-05-07 17:15:23+00:00	Yesterday: 325 new hospitalizations 460 live patients discharged
477	2020-05-07 17:15:11+00:00	We currently have 1,107 ventilators in use. This number continues to DECLINE.
478	2020-05-07 17:14:42+00:00	IMPORTANT: The number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care dropped considerably yesterday to 1,470. This is a milestone – we’ve not been under 1,500 since April 4th.
479	2020-05-07 17:14:16+00:00	At our long-term care facilities, the numbers of positive cases and deaths connected to these facilities continues to grow. However, we’re confident that the efforts we’re taking are going to save lives.
480	2020-05-07 17:13:53+00:00	However, this still means that 4,996 of our fellow New Jerseyans are in the hospital for #COVID19. We still have far too many New Jerseyans in the hospital.
481	2020-05-07 17:12:38+00:00	In just three weeks, we decreased our number of hospitalizations by 40 percent. This number has been brought down in large part because of EACH OF YOU. We cannot let up with our social distancing – the fewer new cases, the fewer people in the hospital. It's that simple.
482	2020-05-07 17:12:23+00:00	LOOK: The number of hospitalizations across our health care systems, regionally, continues to also trend DOWN.
483	2020-05-07 17:11:58+00:00	The number of patients currently being treated in our hospitals for #COVID19 has decreased to under 5,000 – standing currently at 4,996. This is a milestone. It means that the stress on capacity is lessening.
484	2020-05-07 17:11:27+00:00	The rate of spread is SLOWING across the state. This is a very positive sign.
485	2020-05-07 17:11:11+00:00	LOOK: We continue to see the daily counts of new cases leveling. The rate of positivity among those who have been tested also continues to decrease.
486	2020-05-07 17:10:56+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 1,827 new positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 133,635.
487	2020-05-07 17:10:30+00:00	NEW: @NJDHS has availed its Medicaid transportation provider to assist in getting COVID-positive residents at our long-term care facilities both to and from a hospital.
488	2020-05-07 17:09:22+00:00	NEW: I’ve directed the @NJNationalGuard to deploy its members to long-term care facilities beginning this coming weekend to assist in our #COVID19 mitigation efforts. We don’t take this step lightly, but the crisis in our long-term care facilities requires us to take it.
489	2020-05-07 17:07:30+00:00	This is an unemployment crisis unlike that which we have ever seen. Weekly claims are, literally, many times more than @NJLaborDept has historically dealt with across entire months. We've heard you loud and clear. We know you’re frustrated. But, let’s get through this together.

514	2020-05-06 17:16:00+00:00	While these numbers are pointing us in the right direction, they still mean that thousands of our fellow New Jerseyans are still in the hospital battling #COVID19. This is why I needed to extend the public health emergency.
515	2020-05-06 17:15:44+00:00	Yesterday: 439 new hospitalizations 435 live patients discharged
516	2020-05-06 17:15:36+00:00	1,146 ventilators are currently in use. This number continues to DECLINE.

525	2020-05-06 17:10:31+00:00	LOOK: We continue to see the daily counts of new cases leveling, even as more testing sites continue to come online. The rate of positivity among those who are tested also continues to decrease.
526	2020-05-06 17:09:55+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 1,513 additional positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 131,890. REMEMBER: Our total has been growing since March 4th.

527	2020-05-06 17:08:53+00:00	If this extension signals one thing, it is this – we can’t give up one bit on the one thing that we know is working in this fight: social distancing. Remember, in the absence of a vaccine, or even proven therapeutics for #COVID19, our only cure is social distancing.
528	2020-05-06 17:05:15+00:00	NEW: I’m signing an EO to extend our public health emergency by 30 days. To be clear: this does not mean we’re seeing anything in the data which would pause our path forward. These declarations, unless extended, expire after 30 days.

540	2020-05-05 17:23:38+00:00	THOUSANDS of recent graduates will be able to quickly join the teams of health care professionals currently fighting #COVID19. With this army, we will win this war.
541	2020-05-05 17:23:37+00:00	BREAKING: @ConsumerNJ will begin standing up a program to grant temporary emergency licenses to recent graduates of nursing, physician assistant, pharmacy, and respiratory care therapy programs who have not yet been able to take and pass their licensing exams.
542	2020-05-05 17:18:49+00:00	In 1957, Corliss Henry was hired at Muhlenberg Hospital, becoming the first African American nurse on their staff. She earned her Master’s degree in Education at NYU while teaching full-time at Middlesex County College. A life well-lived. We will miss her.
543	2020-05-05 17:17:03+00:00	Dr. Gerald Glisson served as the principal of Paterson’s Eastside High School for the past three years. He was a beloved and respected presence, not to mention a role model. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, his community, and with every life he touched.
544	2020-05-05 17:16:22+00:00	Unfortunately, we continue to lose members of our New Jersey family. Today we report that we’ve lost 334 more. We’ve now lost 8,244 lives to this virus.
545	2020-05-05 17:15:41+00:00	Data determines dates.
546	2020-05-05 17:15:19+00:00	Public health creates economic health.
547	2020-05-05 17:12:30+00:00	Yesterday: 385 new hospitalizations 232 patients released from our hospitals
548	2020-05-05 17:12:06+00:00	Ventilator use currently stands at 1,169. This number, too, continues to decline.
549	2020-05-05 17:11:50+00:00	IMPORTANT: While hospitalizations had a small increase, the number of patients reported in either critical or intensive care dropped to 1,534. We have now had one full week of declining numbers.
550	2020-05-05 17:11:12+00:00	LOOK: The number of hospitalizations across our health care systems, regionally, continue to trend in the right direction.
551	2020-05-05 17:10:43+00:00	As of 10:00 PM last night, 5,328 patients with #COVID19 were being treated in our hospitals. This is a very small increase from Sunday, but still a decrease of nearly 3,000 over the past three weeks.
552	2020-05-05 17:10:12+00:00	LOOK: This map continues to show slowing rates of doubling of new cases. This is a good thing.
553	2020-05-05 17:09:40+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 2,494 additional positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 130,593. We may still have some lagging results from the weekend that we have yet to receive.
554	2020-05-05 17:09:03+00:00	Again, I’m calling on Congress to pass a package of direct state relief, so we can ensure that once we restart our economy, and are on the road to recovery, we can stay on that road.
555	2020-05-05 17:08:57+00:00	We need Congress to step up, in a big way, to provide direct relief to the states. It doesn’t matter if your state is large or small, urban or rural, or led by a Democrat or a Republican. This need is universal.
556	2020-05-05 17:08:30+00:00	We need full flexibility to use our CARES Act funding to cover the escalating costs of our war against #COVID19. We need billions in direct federal assistance to stave off the economic and fiscal catastrophe threatening New Jersey and every state.
557	2020-05-05 17:08:21+00:00	To be clear, we’re not out of the woods yet. This funding was already accounted for in our cash-flow planning – we just didn’t know if Congress would let us use it. We still have a long way to go.
558	2020-05-05 17:08:00+00:00	Because of the new federal flexibility, we will be able to make the next school aid payment of $467 million, which will go out on Friday. This guidance is a win for our educators, a win for 1.4 million students and their families, and a win for our property taxpayers.
559	2020-05-05 17:07:05+00:00	While this new guidance doesn’t get us all the way to where we want – or frankly, need – to be, I’m grateful that we now have greater room to meet some of our immediate needs. We will put this money to good use for our first responders and our small businesses.
560	2020-05-05 17:06:35+00:00	IMPORTANT: We received new guidance yesterday from @stevenmnuchin1 regarding how we can use the $2.4 billion in CARES Act funding that New Jersey has received. We've received greater flexibility in how we can use this money – which means more of it will stay here in New Jersey.
561	2020-05-05 17:05:27+00:00	We know this is an issue not unique to New Jersey. We hope the solutions we find here in New Jersey can be a national model for mitigation, protection, and resiliency – whether it be for COVID-19 or a future pandemic.
562	2020-05-05 17:05:11+00:00	The number of long-term care facilities reporting cases of #COVID19 continues to increase – and the number of cases continues to increase along with it. We’ve lost too many lives of long-term care facilities residents to COVID-19.
563	2020-05-05 17:04:47+00:00	We know the long-term care issue has been among our biggest challenges – if not the biggest. @NewJerseyOAG and @NJDeptofHealth are both leading reviews of our long-term care facilities and enforcing measures to protect residents and staff.

572	2020-05-04 17:44:59+00:00	Nina – Thank you for understanding. I share your disappointment that seniors will not be able to close the school year among their friends. We’re working with districts on safe and creative ways to give you and your classmates a proper send-off.
573	2020-05-04 17:26:48+00:00	This #TeacherAppreciationWeek, I thank our educators, staff, and administrators who have performed heroically during our switch to remote learning, with little time to prepare for this uncharted path. You continually prove why New Jersey has the best public schools in America.
574	2020-05-04 16:53:18+00:00	REMEMBER: The number of new cases and new deaths may be low as a result of a network outage yesterday that may have prevented all cases from being processed.

585	2020-05-04 16:18:32+00:00	Even with the positive trends we’re seeing, we continue to lose too many residents to #COVID19. With heavy hearts, we must report an additional 45 deaths from among our New Jersey family. We’ve now lost 7,910 lives to this virus.
586	2020-05-04 16:17:46+00:00	Yesterday there were 362 new hospitalizations and 335 patients were discharged from our hospitals.
587	2020-05-04 16:17:28+00:00	IMPORTANT: Ventilator use currently stands at 1,189, the LOWEST it’s been in OVER A MONTH.
588	2020-05-04 16:17:12+00:00	UPDATE: As of 10:00 PM last night, there were 1,610 patients reported in either critical or intensive care. This number has decreased every day for the past six days.

593	2020-05-04 16:13:07+00:00	A fiscal disaster is not months away – these decisions will be on our doorstep in just a few weeks. Congress needs to act, and act now. I'll continue to work as I have – with anyone, from either side of the aisle & at every level, to get this done for the people of New Jersey.
594	2020-05-04 16:12:29+00:00	This is not about legacy fiscal issues. Nor is this a “bailout.” This is about keeping our police and firefighters, our EMTs and paramedics, and our public health workers, our educators, among many others, on the job and working to get us through this.
595	2020-05-04 16:11:50+00:00	These discussions aren’t just happening here in New Jersey. They are happening across the nation. We need the federal government to step forward with significant investments in our states – both red & blue – to prevent our recovery from being held back because we cannot fund it.
596	2020-05-04 16:11:32+00:00	NEW: Today I will be vetoing numerous bills the Legislature sent to my desk to appropriate money to any number of causes and programs. I don't want to veto them. But, given our current fiscal situation, I have no other choice.
597	2020-05-04 16:10:54+00:00	Absent significant outside assistance, this surplus is no longer feasible. No administration has been as committed to restoring our state's fiscal foundation than ours. We need to have these funds as a safeguard should direct federal assistance to our state fail to surface.
598	2020-05-04 16:10:30+00:00	NEW: I’m signing an Executive Order that lays bare the severity of the financial crisis we face because of #COVID19.

The NJSIAA Medical Board concluded that due to a lack of testing, viable treatments, and a vaccine, that spring sports were not a viable option.

This will ensure @NewJerseyDEP has the necessary time to make fully informed decisions about permit approvals.
626	2020-05-02 17:17:15+00:00	We have to learn from the data and from the trendlines that are pointing us in a good direction at the moment. We also have to learn from the thousands of lives we have lost. We have to learn that #COVID19 is real, it's virulent, &amp; it's indiscriminate in who it takes from us.
627	2020-05-02 17:16:41+00:00	The family, friends, and neighbors who we have lost are the reason why we cannot rush our restart. We’ve lost so many already to #COVID19, and we know we are going to lose more. If we’re reckless, we will lose many more beyond that.

631	2020-05-02 17:12:05+00:00	Unfortunately, even with the positive trends we’re seeing, we continue to lose too many residents to #COVID19. With heavy hearts, we must report an additional 205 deaths from among our New Jersey family. We’ve now lost 7,742 blessed souls to this virus.
632	2020-05-02 17:11:47+00:00	We’re operating under two very simple ideals here: Public health creates economic health Data determines dates
633	2020-05-02 17:10:45+00:00	There were 378 new hospitalizations yesterday, the lowest one-day count since last weekend. 525 patients were released from our hospitals yesterday.
634	2020-05-02 17:10:21+00:00	Ventilator use currently stands at 1,230, a DECREASE from yesterday.
635	2020-05-02 17:09:54+00:00	As of 10:00 PM last night, there 1,715 patients reported in either critical or intensive care. This continues the overall downward trend over the past week.
636	2020-05-02 17:09:38+00:00	Our Field Medical Stations reported 51 patients, and have treated a total of 393 of our fellow New Jerseyans since opening.
637	2020-05-02 17:09:16+00:00	LOOK: Across every region of the state, we continue to see progress, with each reporting drops in the numbers of hospitalizations yesterday.
638	2020-05-02 17:08:50+00:00	As of 10:00 PM last night, hospitalizations continued to drop significantly, with 5,713 patients currently hospitalized for #COVID19. That’s a drop of more than 1,000 patients in one week.
639	2020-05-02 17:08:21+00:00	If those reports are followed by spikes in the numbers of new cases & increases in the spread of #COVID19 over the next two weeks, then that action would be justified. I hope it’s the first of these two scenarios. I want everyone to enjoy this weekend, but enjoy it responsibly.
640	2020-05-02 17:07:54+00:00	BUT, if we hear reports of people not taking their health – or the health of other park-goers – seriously, I will not hesitate to close them yet again.
641	2020-05-02 17:07:32+00:00	If we hear minimal reports of knucklehead behavior at our parks, then we know you all have taken to heart your responsibility to help us mitigate this pandemic. Frankly, knowing New Jerseyans, this is what I expect. We’re smart and together we’re flattening the curves.
642	2020-05-02 17:06:34+00:00	LOOK: The map of New Jersey continues to get lighter and lighter as the rate of doubling of new cases continues to slow.
643	2020-05-02 17:06:00+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 2,912 additional positive #COVID19 test results, bringing our statewide total to 123,717.
644	2020-05-02 17:05:45+00:00	Ensuring the health of our health care systems is critical to us getting ourselves on the road back. This $1.7 billion will certainly help ensure that our entire health care systems is, itself, healthy to join us on the road back.
645	2020-05-02 17:03:50+00:00	Getting more critical financial aid to our hospitals and health systems to support our front-line health care workers has been a constant and central part of our ongoing dialogue with our federal partners. I thank President @realDonaldTrump and @HHSGov Secretary Azar.
646	2020-05-02 17:02:56+00:00	Altogether, these 53 hospitals will be receiving $1.7 billion directly from the federal government – the second-largest amount of funding awarded, behind only New York. This funding will be deposited with the hospitals in the middle of the upcoming week.
647	2020-05-02 17:02:25+00:00	NEW: Late yesterday, I received a call from @HHSGov Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan where he informed me that, of the 395 hospitals hardest hit by #COVID19 and which will share $12 billion under the latest distribution of federal funds, 53 are in New Jersey.

662	2020-05-01 17:19:25+00:00	No renters are to be threatened with eviction throughout this emergency, and under no circumstances may any landlord even attempt to evict a tenant. No one should fear losing their home.

676	2020-05-01 17:06:17+00:00	LOOK: This map continues to get lighter and lighter as the rate of doubling of new cases continues to slow. This weekend will be a huge test for all of us as to whether or not we stay on this trajectory. We are not out of the wood yet. We all still have to use common sense.

686	2020-05-01 01:18:19+00:00	Reopening our parks and golf courses is the first step toward a “new normal.” We MUST do this right and responsibly: Don’t congregate. Wear masks. Practice social distancing.

689	2020-04-30 21:07:33+00:00	The President and I also discussed the need for direct cash assistance for states ravaged by #COVID19. We need the federal government as a partner in our restart and recovery, just as they have been in our mitigation. I look forward to our continued partnership.

726	2020-04-29 17:48:09+00:00	We’ve now lost more New Jerseyans to #COVID19 than we lost in World War I, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, both Gulf Wars, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Superstorm Sandy, and 9-11 COMBINED. Take this seriously. Stay home. Save lives.
727	2020-04-29 17:28:24+00:00	We know better days will come. We can hasten their arrival if we keep up with our social distancing, washing our hands, and staying at home. We will get there. I promise you.

736	2020-04-29 17:11:51+00:00	Latasha Andrews was a Civilian Security Staff Member Guard with @NJSP, a post she held for the past 14 years. She was a daughter, granddaughter, aunt, sister, cousin, and friend. Tasha was only 33 years old. Thank you for your service, Tasha. May God bless you and your family.
737	2020-04-29 17:10:42+00:00	Across a four decade-long career, Dr. Arthur Freiman was a champion of special needs students and their families. He created the Tri-Valley Academy, which today serves 83 students with autism. Our condolences to his loved ones.
738	2020-04-29 17:08:20+00:00	Today, we’re saddened to report the loss of an additional 329 friends and neighbors. We’ve now lost a total of 6,770 members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications.
739	2020-04-29 17:07:57+00:00	Our mantra remains: public health creates economic health. And that means we keep up with our social distancing. Our health care responders are doing heroic work. But our goal, collectively, is to keep people from having to go to the hospital to begin with.
740	2020-04-29 17:07:43+00:00	For the 24 hours preceding 10:00 PM last night, our hospitals discharged 474 live patients.
741	2020-04-29 17:07:16+00:00	There were 426 new hospitalizations yesterday, and the trend line continues to point in the right direction.
742	2020-04-29 17:06:50+00:00	As of last night, ventilator use ticked up to 1,327 currently in use, but that is also still significantly lower than one week ago.
743	2020-04-29 17:06:06+00:00	As of last night, there were 1,811 patients in either critical or intensive care. This number is virtually unchanged from yesterday, but it remains significantly lower than one week ago.
744	2020-04-29 17:05:56+00:00	Our Field Medical Stations reported 61 patients, and have treated 362 of our fellow New Jerseyans since opening.
745	2020-04-29 17:05:26+00:00	LOOK: This graph shows, by region, how many patients our hospitals are treating. As we can see, we are seeing a downward bend of the curve across both North Jersey and Central Jersey. But, we are seeing the increases now hitting South Jersey.
746	2020-04-29 17:04:40+00:00	As of last night’s reporting, there were 6,289 patients hospitalized for #COVID19. This is one metric where, over the past week, we have seen overall decreases. That’s good.
747	2020-04-29 17:04:14+00:00	STATEWIDE: The rate of doubling of new cases continues slowing in most counties. We NEED to get every county to the lightest shade. We NEED to see #COVID19 being defeated everywhere.
748	2020-04-29 17:03:51+00:00	LOOK: The only way we can get New Jersey on the road back is if we ALL continue our social distancing over the coming weeks to really bend this curve down and keep it going down.
749	2020-04-29 17:03:26+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 2,481 new positive #COVID19 test results, pushing our statewide total to 116,264.

759	2020-04-28 19:06:04+00:00	IMPORTANT: I signed an Executive Order today allowing municipalities to EXTEND the grace period for property tax payments due on May 1st to June 1st. With so many New Jerseyans impacted financially by #COVID19, this is the right thing to do.
760	2020-04-28 17:34:10+00:00	It’s going to take each and every single one of us to keep our focus for the coming several weeks. If we do, we will get on this road, we will secure our collective health, and we will see New Jersey’s economy restart and recover. Let’s keep at it.
761	2020-04-28 17:31:05+00:00	Hillsborough High School students Navleen and Raj Boparai started a Meals for Heroes, a fundraiser to provide front-line heroes with meals. They’ve raised more than $30,000 and delivered more than 3,000 meals. #NJThanksYou!

764	2020-04-28 17:27:37+00:00	The Commission’s work will not just be on the short term, but on potential long-term investments that will speed our recovery and position our economy for overall success.

784	2020-04-28 17:22:57+00:00	THREAD: I’ve assembled the Governor’s Restart and Recovery Commission to help guide our recovery. This team is unrivaled in terms of its diversity of experiences, perspectives, and expertise. We will restart our economy with purely Jersey solutions. Here’s who they are:
785	2020-04-28 17:18:37+00:00	NEW: I’m signing an EO permitting municipal governments to extend the grace period for property tax payments due this Friday, 5/1, until 6/1. Under existing law, municipalities are only allowed to allow grace periods of up to 10 days – I'm extending this for an entire month.
786	2020-04-28 17:14:55+00:00	Maintaining our social distancing isn’t just about getting us to the point where we can begin our restart – it’s about saving lives. That’s our end goal – to save lives.
787	2020-04-28 17:12:20+00:00	Thomas Leonard was a longtime Montclairian. He was an attorney and a diehard @Giants-@Mets-@NYRangers fan who stuck with his teams through good times and bad. He loved to play along with @Jeopardy. He loved life. May God bless him and his family.
788	2020-04-28 17:10:57+00:00	Ed Harris was born in Holmdel and owned a landscaping business, Holmdel Farms. He loved sports and was an AAU basketball & baseball coach. Community ran in his blood. To his family & to everyone who loved Ed – I hope the memories of him help sustain you through this trying time.
789	2020-04-28 17:09:34+00:00	In 1997, Gary Walker became a firefighter in Oakland, Bergen County, eventually rising to be the assistant chief of Fire Company No. 2. He served as a patrol officer in the Bloomingdale Police Department for over 20 years. Our hearts are with his loved ones.
790	2020-04-28 17:09:17+00:00	NOTE: This is not a one-day total of 402. We expected that more deaths which occurred over the weekend just had yet to be counted. Now they have.
791	2020-04-28 17:09:13+00:00	While we’re seeing progress in some key metrics, there is one number which always gives us pause. Sadly, we must report 402 additional deaths. We’ve now lost a total of 6,442 members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications.
792	2020-04-28 17:07:31+00:00	HUGE MILESTONE: @HackensackUMC will be discharging its 1,000th #COVID19 patient today.
793	2020-04-28 17:06:02+00:00	As of 10:00 PM last night: 6,476 residents hospitalized for #COVID19 60 patients at our Field Medical Stations 1,809 patients in either critical or intensive care 1,262 ventilators currently in use 488 new hospitalizations yesterday 419 discharges
794	2020-04-28 17:05:23+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 2,887 new positive #COVID19 test results, pushing our statewide total to 113,856. There were duplicate test results that have been removed from yesterday, so that is how we reach our current total.
795	2020-04-28 17:01:11+00:00	Holding a COVID-19 briefing. WATCH:
796	2020-04-28 15:31:00+00:00	A native of Newark, Bernard Gersten was a theater giant. He was a pioneering force at @LCTheater and the Public Theater, keeping me and countless other fans singing and smiling. A sad, sad loss for American theater.

800	2020-04-27 19:59:19+00:00	Together, we will restore our economic health by ensuring public health. We will build our resiliency. We are #JerseyStrong and we will emerge from this – stronger than ever.

802	2020-04-27 19:59:16+00:00	Today I unveiled The Road Back – a vision to put our state, and our people, on the road to recovery. Our plan is guided by one overarching principle: public health creates economic health. We will be driven by data, science, and common sense. https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200427b.shtml
803	2020-04-27 17:30:20+00:00	PLEASE NOTE: Because of our briefing’s early start time today, these numbers are incomplete as they only reflect the positive results received as of last night.

807	2020-04-27 17:30:18+00:00	We have 2,146 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our total to 111,188. • Atlantic: 749 • Bergen: 15,104 • Burlington: 2,407 • Camden: 3,124 • Cape May: 281 • Cumberland: 595 • Essex: 13,047 • Gloucester: 1,111 • Hudson: 13,925 • Hunterdon: 564
808	2020-04-27 16:25:05+00:00	Let’s do this together. Let’s start by lowering the curve. We can do this if we all keep focus over the coming weeks. We will reach our destination – a New Jersey that is restored to economic health because we took the steps to restore, and secure, our collective health.
809	2020-04-27 16:24:40+00:00	I don’t know when we’ll be able to formally and finally start this journey. We will be ready to put the car in gear as soon as we see a green light. This is a plan for HOW we move forward – not IF we move forward.
810	2020-04-27 16:24:16+00:00	As we work to put New Jersey back on the road of progress and prosperity, we know that this war is still far from over. We need to continue focusing on our social distancing and taking the steps necessary to #FlattenTheCurve so we can move down this road.
811	2020-04-27 16:22:45+00:00	 ENSURE NEW JERSEY’S RESILIENCY We cannot think of #COVID19 as a one-and-done. We will: Ensure our hospitals and health care systems have inventories of PPE and ventilators Build a state stockpile of PPE and ventilators Create a playbook for future administrations
812	2020-04-27 16:21:55+00:00	We have to be thoughtful in how we unfold our economy. This virus is now among us. Our task will be to contain it as best we can With our public-health protocols firmly in place, and with our health care system prepared, you should not fear heading back to work or elsewhere.
813	2020-04-27 16:21:39+00:00	I want nothing more than to see every Main Street filled with shoppers and diners once again. I want our construction sites roaring with activity once again. I want to see the Shore humming through the Summer. We will move as quickly as we can, but as safely as we must.
814	2020-04-27 16:21:07+00:00	Our Commission will give the highest priority for reopening using a clear standard of “essential and safe”: Essential to our economy Provide the lowest risks of infection and spread. Then, we can move up the matrix, until we achieve a fully functioning and open economy.
815	2020-04-27 16:20:49+00:00	 RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC RESTART We'll plan for a methodical and strategic return to work. We'll form the Governor’s Restart and Recovery Commission. We'll continue social distancing measures, like requirements for face coverings and work-from-home directions where feasible.
816	2020-04-27 16:17:27+00:00	 SECURE SAFE PLACES FOR ISOLATION To the greatest extent possible, we will provide individuals who test positive for #COVID19 in the future with a safe and free place to isolate. We must also be prepared to support these people with supportive services, as needed.
817	2020-04-27 16:15:59+00:00	 IMPLEMENT ROBUST CONTACT TRACING We will: Deploy an army of contact tracers to help stop the spread of #COVID19 Leverage technological data and innovative solutions to increase efficiency Coordinate with local and state health officials
818	2020-04-27 16:15:28+00:00	 EXPAND TESTING CAPACITY We're actively working toward doubling our diagnostic testing capacity by the end of May. We'll have a flexible testing plan that is accessible to all residents who need it. We’re working with the @WhiteHouse to meet this threshold.
819	2020-04-27 16:13:57+00:00	 SUSTAINED REDUCTIONS IN NEW CASES AND HOSPITALIZATIONS We will need to see: 14-day trend lines showing sustained drop in new #COVID19 cases and hospitalizations Hospitals stepping down from resorting to crisis standards of care
820	2020-04-27 16:13:40+00:00	Our Stay-at-Home Order, which has been in effect since March 21st, will remain in effect in its entirety until further notice.
821	2020-04-27 16:13:12+00:00	SECURING PUBLIC HEALTH: Sustained reductions in new cases and hospitalizations Expand testing capacity Implement robust contact tracing Secure safe places for isolation People need to know, first and foremost, that their health will be safeguarded from #COVID19.
822	2020-04-27 16:11:49+00:00	SIX PRINCIPLES TO RESTORE ECONOMIC HEALTH THROUGH PUBLIC HEALTH: Sustained reductions in new #COVID19 cases &amp; hospitalizations Expand testing capacity Implement robust contact tracing Secure safe places for isolation Responsible economic restart Ensure NJ’s resiliency
823	2020-04-27 16:10:37+00:00	We'll ensure that our road back merges with those being traveled by our regional partners through the Multi-State Council. This isn’t just about NJ. Rushing ahead of our partners would risk returning our entire region back into lockdown mode. We only want to have to do this once.
824	2020-04-27 16:10:04+00:00	#COVID19 has had an outsized impact on our communities of color. This virus did not create the inequalities in our society, but it laid them bare. As we travel this road, we will use this opportunity to help close those gaps.
825	2020-04-27 16:09:13+00:00	Let me repeat a basic truth: Until we give the public confidence that they should not be fearful, we cannot take further steps. A plan that is needlessly rushed is a plan that will needlessly fail.
826	2020-04-27 16:08:44+00:00	The Road Back from #COVID19 is driven by: Data Science Health progress Common sense We will use rigorous standards that are equally smart and thoughtful, and everything we do will be filtered through our New Jersey values.
827	2020-04-27 16:07:37+00:00	Today I’m announcing The Road Back – a roadmap to restore the health, strength, and well-being of New Jersey for the long-term. We will be guided by one overarching principle: public health creates economic health.
828	2020-04-27 16:05:30+00:00	As of 10:00 PM last night: 6,407 residents hospitalized for #COVID19 75 patients at our Field Medical Stations 1,801 patients in either critical or intensive care 1,303 ventilators currently in use 314 new hospitalizations yesterday 480 discharges
829	2020-04-27 16:04:58+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost 106 more members of our New Jersey family to COVID-19 related complications. We’ve now lost 6,044 blessed souls to this invisible enemy.
830	2020-04-27 16:04:06+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 2,146 new confirmed #COVID19 positive test results, pushing our statewide total to 111,188. PLEASE NOTE: Because of our early start time today, these numbers are incomplete as they only reflect the positive results received as of last night.
831	2020-04-27 16:01:18+00:00	Announcing our roadmap for restoring New Jersey’s economic health through public health. WATCH LIVE:

840	2020-04-25 17:48:34+00:00	We’ve lost more New Jerseyans to coronavirus than we lost in World War I, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War COMBINED. When we say we’re in a war, we mean it. This is literally a war.
841	2020-04-25 17:40:24+00:00	UPDATE: New #COVID19 cases: 3,457 Total cases: 105,523

846	2020-04-25 17:21:10+00:00	We can’t let a beautiful spring day allow us to slip on our social distancing. We have to keep at it. There will be many more beautiful spring days ahead, and I want us to be able to enjoy them together.
847	2020-04-25 17:19:23+00:00	A huge shout-out to all the leaders across @MiddlesexCntyNJ for the amazing cross-county partnerships that have been forged to ensure that health care workers have the PPE they need to stay safe on the job. It takes a village – or in this case, a county. #NJThanksYou!
848	2020-04-25 17:18:52+00:00	Natalie IX is selling yard signs that show support for our front-line workers & is using the proceeds to buy pizza for our front-line army. Just as importantly, she’s supporting small businesses by printing the signs locally & ordering pizza from a local restaurant. #NJThanksYou!
849	2020-04-25 17:18:28+00:00	This is New Jersey. Our reach into the life sciences is deep and strong. With a multitude of great partners – from @RutgersU to our private labs – we are confident that we will be able to stand up the testing regime we will need to move forward.
850	2020-04-25 17:17:53+00:00	Ensuring the public’s health must come before we can begin restarting our economy. We’re continually pushing to expand our testing capabilities. Having a robust and accessible program is a key program that we will need to have in place for the weeks to come.
851	2020-04-25 17:16:31+00:00	TESTING INFO: There are currently 95 locations across the state where residents can be tested for #COVID19. We have listed the information for 30 publicly-run and community-based testing sites at http://covid19.nj.gov/testing.
852	2020-04-25 17:15:46+00:00	NEW: We’ve set up an information page for homeowners with questions regarding their rights under the mortgage forbearance agreements we have reached with multiple lenders. Visit: http://covid19.nj.gov/mortgage.
853	2020-04-25 17:15:25+00:00	NEW: We’ve set up an information page that explicitly spells out the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords. We urge every tenant and landlord to make this their first stop when there is an issue. Visit: http://covid19.nj.gov/renter.
854	2020-04-25 17:15:07+00:00	We must reiterate: NO renters are to be threatened with eviction throughout this emergency, and under no circumstances may any landlord even attempt to evict a tenant. No one should fear losing their home. Period.
855	2020-04-25 17:13:34+00:00	The 5,863 who we have lost must be our inspiration so we do not lose another 5,863. We must redouble our efforts to stop the spread of #COVID19. This is in our doing. We are New Jersey tough through and through.
856	2020-04-25 17:12:05+00:00	Filomena Phyllis Acerra Diebold lived in Long Branch, where she was born and raised. She served as an administrator in the Monmouth County Prosecutors Office for 25 years. To say Phyl had an indominable spirit would be an understatement. Our hearts are with her loved ones.
857	2020-04-25 17:09:18+00:00	Reverend Rufus McClendon Jr. was pastor of First-Park Baptist Church in Plainfield. He was an educator in the Newark Public Schools for 28 years and served as head chaplain of East Jersey State Prison from 1994 until 2008. May God bless his memory, and his family.
858	2020-04-25 17:08:16+00:00	Kenneth House loved to fly. As a boy, he used the money he earned from his paper route to pay for flying lessons at Somerset Airport. He flew commercial planes for years and, in 1991, he founded KIWI Airlines with fellow pilots. Our hearts are with his family.
859	2020-04-25 17:07:20+00:00	Sadly, we must report 249 additional deaths. We’ve now lost a total of 5,863 blessed members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19 related complications. This is the worst number we report every day.
860	2020-04-25 17:06:46+00:00	For the 24 hours preceding 10:00 PM last night, our hospitals reported 686 total discharges. If you look at the three-day average, DISCHARGES continue to EXCEED ADMITTANCES. This is an important measure for hospital readiness and the availability of beds for those who need them.
861	2020-04-25 17:06:35+00:00	We saw 561 new hospitalizations yesterday. While we continue to see one-day increases and decreases, the overall trend line continues to keep moving in the right direction.
862	2020-04-25 17:06:12+00:00	IMPORTANT: Ventilator use continues to trend downward, to 1,442 currently in use.
863	2020-04-25 17:05:55+00:00	As of 10:30PM last night, there 1,971 patients in either critical or intensive care. We see that this number has remained steady over the past week.
864	2020-04-25 17:05:23+00:00	As of 10:30PM last night: 6,722 New Jerseyans hospitalized for #COVID19 – meaning we’ve had consecutive decreases since Thursday 99 patients at our Field Medical Stations
865	2020-04-25 17:04:31+00:00	LOOK at the curve of new #COVID19 cases. We see continued flattening. We cannot ease up one bit on our social distancing. We need to see more progress and more slowing.
866	2020-04-25 17:01:23+00:00	Holding a COVID-19 briefing. WATCH:
867	2020-04-25 14:50:00+00:00	Rosemary – I’m so happy to hear that both you and your husband have recovered. We’re all wishing you continued good health and are excited for your little one to join our New Jersey family!

869	2020-04-25 00:36:18+00:00	NEW: @NJSP Colonel Callahan and I just announced protections for individuals without safe, permanent housing. Providing our most vulnerable populations with access to safe accommodations during the #COVID19 crisis is both the right thing to do and a matter of public health.
870	2020-04-24 22:04:55+00:00	Today I signed an Executive Order allowing renters to direct their landlords to use their security deposits to offset rent or back rent. This will provide New Jerseyans with critical short-term support as the first of the month approaches.
871	2020-04-24 20:15:27+00:00	Participated in a #COVID19 video call today with @VP and fellow governors, where I reiterated our need for direct cash assistance. I will be persistent and stay at this because, if we don’t get direct cash assistance, we will have to make awful choices.
872	2020-04-24 20:14:19+00:00	I had a productive call this morning with @stevenmnuchin1, where I discussed our need to get the money that’s rightfully ours from the CARES Act. Our conversation was a good step in the right direction, but we’re not over the goal line yet.
873	2020-04-24 20:05:18+00:00	• Mercer: 178 • Middlesex: 413 • Monmouth: 273 • Morris: 340 • Ocean: 301 • Passaic: 383 • Salem: 6 • Somerset: 198 • Sussex: 84 • Union: 542 • Warren: 61

877	2020-04-24 19:48:28+00:00	Tammy and I are deeply saddened by the passing of First Lady Debby Kean. Throughout Governor Kean’s administration, she remained a strong presence. We are keeping Governor Kean in our family’s prayers at this time, as well as Tom, Jr., Alexandra, and Reed, and their families.
878	2020-04-24 19:38:23+00:00	I received this picture from Kevin Slavin, the CEO of @sjh_nj. Here are his son, Sean, and daughter-in-law, Emily, with our newest New Jerseyan, Rosemary Slavin. Everyone is safe and healthy. Welcome to our New Jersey family, Rosemary!
879	2020-04-24 19:37:41+00:00	This is no time for us to give up. Let’s keep at it. We will win this.
880	2020-04-24 19:37:22+00:00	Shout-out to our terrific production and technology team. Without their work, our daily briefings would not happen. #NJThanksYou Bill Nutter, Mike Santoro, Sydney Justice, Jack Hensley, Sara Casey, Roy Woods, Carol McKenna, and Chris Chiarkas!
881	2020-04-24 19:36:09+00:00	Four students from the LEAP Academy in Camden are using the school’s 3D printers to create 1,000 face shields for our front-line health care workers. They’re 150 face shields deep into their project, and are going to keep going until the rest of their goal is met. #NJThanksYou!
882	2020-04-24 19:35:17+00:00	Every Friday for the past 18 months, 14-year-old Josh Enberg has been volunteering with the Sparta Ecumenical Food Pantry. During #COVID19, the pantry has found itself short-handed, but Josh has been stepping up his volunteering time to help fill the gaps. #NJThanksYou!
883	2020-04-24 19:33:57+00:00	The diversity of our state, and our nation for that matter, is one of our strongest assets. This is no time for folks to blame one group or another, especially our Asian brothers and sisters, who have stepped up tremendously.
884	2020-04-24 19:33:50+00:00	Thank you to Angelo and Tina Koo, who are donating one million surgical masks today. Our global community has stepped forward like never before to help us. I thank the people of Taiwan for their continued support.
885	2020-04-24 19:32:59+00:00	It’s a very simple equation – public health creates economic health. The sooner we have the testing that we need in place, the sooner we can give our residents the confidence they will need to know that they will be safe once we begin down the road to the “new normal.”
886	2020-04-24 19:32:17+00:00	We continue to press our federal partners for the necessary waivers to open up testing for more individuals. We’re working with great partners – @RutgersU and our private labs – to bring new testing systems and fast-tracked test-processing into broad use.
887	2020-04-24 19:31:58+00:00	TESTING: We’re now up to 95 locations across the state where residents can be tested for #COVID19. 30 publicly-run or community-based testing sites can be found at http://covid19.nj.gov. We’re working diligently to continually expand testing across the state.
888	2020-04-24 19:31:27+00:00	As a reminder: If you are a landlord who has requested mortgage forbearance from your lender, we fully expect that you extend that relief to your tenants, as well.
889	2020-04-24 19:31:19+00:00	We recognize that federal rules allow for lenders to ask for skipped payments up-front, and we are pushing to have those rules changed.
890	2020-04-24 19:30:50+00:00	NEW: We’re standing up an additional info page for homeowners taking advantage of our previously announced mortgage forbearance. To be perfectly clear: Our expectation for lenders that are part of our agreement is for them to tack the forborne payments on to THE END OF THE LOAN.
891	2020-04-24 19:29:32+00:00	NEW: Through @NJ_DCA, we’re standing up a single online FAQ section to be a point-of-reference for both tenants and landlords as to their rights and responsibilities. Everyone will have access to the same information, so there can be no more misunderstandings.
892	2020-04-24 19:28:34+00:00	BREAKING: Today I’m signing an executive order allowing renters to to direct their landlords to use their security deposits to pay their rents, whether that be to make up for a shortfall or to pay it in full.
893	2020-04-24 19:28:17+00:00	We have lost more New Jerseyans to #COVID19 than we have in some of our nation’s wars, and more than we lost on 9-11. Let’s include every single person we have lost in the annals of our state’s history. They cannot and will not be forgotten. For them, we will move forward.
894	2020-04-24 19:22:40+00:00	James “Jimmie” LaBarbiera was the brother of one of my dear friends, and the mayor of Paramus, Richard LaBarbiera. He embodies the values of our New Jersey family – humor, decency, and love of family. He leaves behind his wife and his two sons. Our prayers are with his family.
895	2020-04-24 19:21:47+00:00	Khristian Aviles was a senior at @wpunj_edu, where he was a mainstay on the Dean’s List. He had a deep interest in public service and was also a talented artist. His was a very bright light that has been extinguished far, far too early. May God bless him and his family.
896	2020-04-24 19:19:32+00:00	For the past two decades, Gerry Genuino served the families and children of Fair Lawn, starting as a custodian at the Warren Point Elementary School before becoming a well-known and beloved bus driver. Our hearts are with his wife, two daughters, and his community.
897	2020-04-24 19:18:33+00:00	LOOK: For the 24 hours preceding 10:00 PM last night, our hospitals reported 778 total discharges. If you look at the 3-day average, we see discharges EXCEEDING admittances.
898	2020-04-24 19:18:10+00:00	NEW: We saw 385 new hospitalizations yesterday. This chart shows how we’ve seen ups and downs over the past few days – but the 3-day average trend line is generally moving in the right direction, DOWN.
899	2020-04-24 19:17:49+00:00	As of 10:30 PM last night: 1,933 patients in either critical or intensive care – virtually unchanged 1,487 ventilators in use – a considerable one-day drop
900	2020-04-24 19:17:24+00:00	As of 10:30 PM last night: 6,847 residents hospitalized for #COVID19 – a DECREASE from what we’ve been seeing 98 patients at our Field Medical Stations
901	2020-04-24 19:16:50+00:00	We cannot ease up one bit on our social distancing. I am not in a position yet to begin reopening our state and jumpstarting our economy. We need to see more progress, and more slowing, before we can begin those considerations.
902	2020-04-24 19:16:32+00:00	IMPORTANT: Several counties have SLID BACKWARD. I cannot be any more plain – everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread of #COVID19. We have to work together to lighten this map.
903	2020-04-24 19:14:57+00:00	Sadly, we must report 253 additional lives lost. We’ve now lost 5,617 of our blessed New Jerseyans to #COVID19 related complications.
904	2020-04-24 19:14:22+00:00	UPDATE: We have 3,047 new positive #COVID19 test results, pushing our state total to 102,196. As we cross 100,000, we must keep in mind that there are tens of thousands of New Jerseyans who had tested positive over the past seven weeks and who have beaten COVID-19.

909	2020-04-23 21:02:19+00:00	I don’t wake up every morning or go to bed every night thinking about Democrats or Republicans, red or blue. I think about saving American lives and protecting New Jersey's families. The red, white, and blue.
910	2020-04-23 20:31:41+00:00	Our five state-run residential facilities for adults with developmental disabilities will implement @RutgersBHS's #COVID19 saliva-based testing. I'm grateful for our partnership with @RutgersU and incredibly proud of their innovative breakthrough to help NJ defeat this virus.
911	2020-04-23 18:41:39+00:00	REMEMBER: Practice social distancing as you practice your faith. Iftars should be held virtually or with immediate family members only – so that next year, we can join together once again.
912	2020-04-23 18:41:39+00:00	Tammy and I wish all of our Muslim brothers and sisters in New Jersey and around the world a blessed Ramadan. #RamadanMubarak #RamadanKareem

917	2020-04-23 17:32:20+00:00	We will not relent until the federal government provides the support we need to protect the services that millions of residents rely upon. Remember this – I will never stop fighting for you.
918	2020-04-23 17:32:10+00:00	$1.8 billion was never enough to begin with, but at the very least we should be able to support our people, and help keep the funding that municipalities and school districts are expecting whole.
919	2020-04-23 17:30:59+00:00	Sadly, the message from Washington to our first responders and to our educators is clear: as you work tirelessly to stop this pandemic, to keep people safe, our national leadership thinks you are not essential, that you should fear for your jobs.
920	2020-04-23 17:30:42+00:00	If the federal government doesn’t do its job and support New Jersey families, we may not be able to keep our teachers, cops, firefighters and paramedics employed – the very people who are on the front lines every day.
921	2020-04-23 17:30:31+00:00	For the last two years we have done something unique for New Jersey – we’ve put some money away for a rainy day. When we close our economy, as we have had to, to slow the spread and save lives, that income goes away.
922	2020-04-23 17:30:07+00:00	Unlike the federal government, which can run trillion-dollar deficits every year, New Jersey can’t. I – just like New Jersey’s families – have to budget based on certain income and certain expenses.
923	2020-04-23 17:29:40+00:00	.@USTreasury’s guidance renders much of this funding unusable. Without additional flexibility, we will likely have to return a good chunk of it to the federal government.
924	2020-04-23 17:29:24+00:00	Yesterday, we received bad news from @USTreasury when they issued guidance on how we can use funding from the CARES Act. I was assured that funding from the CARES Act would be able to be used flexibly by states. Those assurances, apparently, were empty.
925	2020-04-23 17:27:27+00:00	I have been clear for weeks that if we do not get significant, direct, and flexible financial support from the federal government, we will be forced to make many difficult decisions. That doesn’t just go for New Jersey, but for many of our sister states, red and blue.
926	2020-04-23 17:26:24+00:00	New Jersey-based Premium Nature donated 500 gallons of hand sanitizer to @ReadyNJ to help our frontline heroes. @NJSP Chaplain @RabbiAFriedman was there along with Reverend John Taylor and NJSP personnel to accept this donation. #NJThanksYou!
927	2020-04-23 17:25:16+00:00	.@ATT has also stepped forward with critical financial support for the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, so they can provide for those in our communities who need helping hand. #NJThanksYou!
928	2020-04-23 17:25:04+00:00	.@ATT and the AT&amp;T Foundation have partnered with the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association to provide meals from local restaurants to the health care professionals and support staff at our Field Medical Stations in Secaucus and Edison.
929	2020-04-23 17:23:21+00:00	REMEMBER: No one will be denied one penny of the unemployment benefits they deserve.
930	2020-04-23 17:22:31+00:00	Since March 15th, more than 858,000 New Jerseyans have filed for unemployment benefits. One year ago, that total number collecting unemployment was only 84,000. @NJLaborDept continues to do everything it can to streamline processes and ensure that all claims are handled quickly.
931	2020-04-23 17:22:15+00:00	.@NJLaborDept reported this morning that an additional 140,000 New Jerseyans filed for unemployment last week. $1 billion in unemployment benefits have now been distributed since this emergency began a little more than a month ago.
932	2020-04-23 17:21:27+00:00	Our state is the historic home of innovations in the life sciences, and now we have a huge breakthrough coming from our very own flagship university. @RutgersU – thank you for this testing system and for all the other advances being made on the banks of the Old Raritan.
933	2020-04-23 17:20:33+00:00	Having an @US_FDA-approved test that can provide us rapid results is critical. Through their saliva-based test system, @RutgersU is in position to help us get there. This is a tremendous point of Jersey pride for us all.
934	2020-04-23 17:19:43+00:00	Testing will be the start-point for any contact tracing program we will be able to implement. Without testing, we will not be able to take the necessary steps to contain future cases and prevent them from becoming boomerang outbreaks.
935	2020-04-23 17:19:34+00:00	Having a robust and greatly expanded testing program in place is vital to us being able to begin reopening our state. We need to be able to roughly double our testing capacity as a benchmark.
936	2020-04-23 17:19:26+00:00	The @RutgersU testing is already going into wide use: By our state’s largest health care systems At the PBA-sponsored first-responder test sites Soon at many other places statewide
937	2020-04-23 17:18:51+00:00	We are working to expand testing to other state workers and the individuals we serve. These tests would not have been as quickly administered if not for the testing system created by @RutgersBHS Chancellor Brian Strom’s team.
938	2020-04-23 17:18:38+00:00	These are among our most vulnerable residents and our most essential workers. We owe our residents and staff our best, and testing will help us best serve them.
939	2020-04-23 17:17:30+00:00	NEW: We will begin testing all residents and staff at each of our five state developmental centers next week because of the new saliva-based testing developed by @RutgersU. This is a total of more than 5,500 tests – more than 1,200 residents, and in excess of 4,300 staff.
940	2020-04-23 17:15:17+00:00	Rick Vanderclock was a member of the 85th class of the @NJSP Academy. He was a Trooper for 29 years. He leaves behind his wife of 46 years, two sons, and four grandchildren. May his memory bring them comfort at this difficult time, and happiness in the times to come.
941	2020-04-23 17:14:18+00:00	Dave Clark was a firefighter with the Bay Head Fire Company, where he filled any role that needed to be filled, from chief engineer to safety officer. Bay Head has lost one of its bravest. To Dave, we thank you for your service, and to the entire Clark family, we are with you.
942	2020-04-23 17:12:51+00:00	Carolyn Martins-Reitz was the primary caregiver for her son, Thomas Martins, who had Down Syndrome. #COVID19 took Carolyn away from her family at the end of March. Just a little over a week later, it also took Thomas. They lived tremendous lives. Our hearts are with their family.
943	2020-04-23 17:12:11+00:00	For the 24 hours preceding 10:00 PM last night, our hospitals reported 752 discharges – almost equal to new admittances.
944	2020-04-23 17:11:38+00:00	As of 10:30 PM last night: 1,990 patients in either critical or intensive care – this number remains virtually unchanged Ventilator use had a considerable one-day drop to 1,462. That is the lowest it has been since April 5th
945	2020-04-23 17:11:15+00:00	LOOK at the rate of new hospitalizations. We see an uptick from yesterday, but still below our previous highs.
946	2020-04-23 17:11:00+00:00	As of 10:30 PM last night: 7,240 residents hospitalized for #COVID19 91 patients at our field medical stations
947	2020-04-23 17:08:29+00:00	We continue to see: The curve of new #COVID19 cases remains significantly flat A slowing of the rate of spread But, we CANNOT ease up one bit on our social distancing. I am not in a position yet to begin reopening our state and jumpstarting our economy.
948	2020-04-23 17:07:26+00:00	Sadly, we must report 307 additional deaths. We’ve now lost a total of 5,368 New Jerseyans to #COVID19 related complications.
949	2020-04-23 17:06:56+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 4,247 new positive #COVID19 test results, pushing our state total to 99,989. Of the nearly 100,000 total cases we’ve reported since our first positive case on March 4th, roughly 46,000 of these individuals have now exited the two-week incubation window.
950	2020-04-23 17:02:41+00:00	Holding a COVID-19 briefing. WATCH:
951	2020-04-23 15:37:49+00:00	The embodiment of our New Jersey values – Rick Sabato and the Bergen County Building and Construction Trades Council are on the job, doing essential construction at our health care facilities, while showing support for our health care workers. We’re all in this together.

953	2020-04-23 01:19:42+00:00	.@senatemajldr ENCOURAGING states to GO BANKRUPT in a moment of crisis is wildly irresponsible. As usual, he's dead wrong. We won't go bankrupt, but we will leave the American people in the lurch at their most profound hour of need if the federal government doesn't step up. Now.
954	2020-04-23 01:02:14+00:00	I am so inspired – visiting our field hospitals and alternative care sites, meeting with first responders, health care workers, and others creating this infrastructure to support New Jerseyans. We are in this together. We have built an army to battle #COVID19, and we will win.
955	2020-04-22 21:49:34+00:00	For 50 years, @NewJerseyDEP has fought for our environment. Today, with the leadership of @NJDEPMcCabe, we're blazing the trail to a 100% clean energy New Jersey by 2050. To 50 more years, and beyond, of following the science. #EarthDay2020

961	2020-04-22 20:25:05+00:00	#COVID19 has had an outsized impact on communities of color. Today I signed legislation requiring hospitals to report demographic data – including race, age, and gender – to the @NJDeptofHealth. This data will help ensure equity in our response. We will leave no one behind.

963	2020-04-22 19:33:04+00:00	Eleven friends from @ColoniaHigh have created “Colonia Cares.” They’re selling yard signs and t-shirts, with all the proceeds being turned into gift cards from local businesses, which are then being donated to a local food bank as well as Woodbridge Social Services. #NJThanksYou!
964	2020-04-22 19:32:00+00:00	Lori Essa, her mother in-law Haifa, and sister-in-law Amal have put their sewing machines to use to produce cloth face coverings that they are donating to JFK Hospital and throughout the community. So far, they’ve made and distributed close to 4,000 pieces. #NJThanksYou!
965	2020-04-22 19:31:33+00:00	United Chinese Americans has donated more than 10,000 N95 masks, 10,000 surgical masks, 80,000 medical gloves, 2,700 protective goggles, & 400 protective gowns for our front-line health care workers. We’re grateful to our strong & growing Chinese American community. #NJThanksYou
966	2020-04-22 19:27:31+00:00	We cannot do this alone. We cannot have this fight lead to an inevitable set of draconian cuts that will hurt our ability to help get our people back up off the mat. We need the federal government’s help to avoid this fate.
967	2020-04-22 19:27:05+00:00	We’re dealing with an unprecedented public health crisis that will be followed by an unprecedented fiscal crisis. Without substantial and direct financial assistance from the federal government, the programs that we care deeply about, and which we will lean on, will be at risk.
968	2020-04-22 19:26:28+00:00	Congress is preparing for final passage of another #COVID19 support package. I cannot overlook the fact that it is absent of any direct state assistance. We need to see bill with direct state assistance on @realDonaldTrump’s desk.
969	2020-04-22 19:25:36+00:00	This information will be critical for us to fully understand the impact that #COVID19 has had on our diverse communities, as we can already tell from the preliminary data that this emergency has had an outsized impact on our communities of color.
970	2020-04-22 19:25:26+00:00	I will sign legislation requiring our hospitals to report to @NJDeptofHealth all demographic &amp; racial data for all individuals who have tested positive for #COVID19, who have been admitted &amp; who have died – as well as the number who have tried to get tested but were unsuccessful.
971	2020-04-22 19:20:50+00:00	Yesterday, @ReadyNJ received a shipment of 500 ventilators that the state purchased. We procured these ventilators to ensure – to the very best of our ability – that every New Jerseyan who needs a ventilator has one.
972	2020-04-22 19:18:23+00:00	We’re continuing our tri-state partnership with @NYGovCuomo and @GovNedLamont. Our three states are working on a contact tracing program. This discussion is in its very early stages, but we all recognize that robust contact tracing is vital to any serious reopening efforts.
973	2020-04-22 19:16:23+00:00	We lost John Ferrarella, retired Paterson Fire Captain and member of Wayne Fire Company No. 3, one week ago. He served in the @USMC during the Vietnam War. He remained active as an EMT up until the end. We thank him for his years of service. Our hearts are with his family.
974	2020-04-22 19:14:28+00:00	Kevin Kurdyla was a football standout at East Side High in Newark. He attended @RutgersU and earned a ticket to the Rutgers Hall of Fame. In his four years, @RFootball went 32-13. He went to work with the production team at the @starledger. Our hearts are with his loved ones.
975	2020-04-22 19:12:47+00:00	For three decades, John Carreccia worked for @PANYNJ at @EWRairport and the World Trade Center. Since his retirement, he remained active and was serving as the Chief of the Woodbridge Township Ambulance and Rescue Squad. We will keep him and his family in our thoughts.
976	2020-04-22 19:12:00+00:00	Our number one mission remains unchanged: to save lives. Period.
977	2020-04-22 19:10:34+00:00	LOOK: The number of discharges versus the number of new admittances. Today the lines are intersecting again with more discharges than admittances.
978	2020-04-22 19:10:10+00:00	NEW: New hospitalizations DROPPED yesterday. We need to see this number begin a sustained decrease. This is, and will remain, our most important measure of progress, as the rate of new hospitalizations has a direct correlation to the number of new positive test results.
979	2020-04-22 19:09:51+00:00	IMPORTANT: The overall number of patients in critical or intensive care remains STABLE, as does the numbers of ventilators in use. We need these numbers to begin to decrease before we can move to our next phase. But, not seeing any significant increases is a good starting point.
980	2020-04-22 19:09:14+00:00	As of 10:30 PM last night: 7,210 residents hospitalized for #COVID19 1,983 individuals in either critical or intensive care 1,570 ventilators in use. 84 patients at our field medical stations 745 discharges
981	2020-04-22 19:07:55+00:00	LOOK: In 14 of our counties, the rate of spread has slowed to between 14 to 30 days. In 7 counties, it’s 7 to 14 days. We need to push like never before to get every county to be the lightest shade.
982	2020-04-22 19:06:20+00:00	We continue to see the curve of new cases remains significantly flat. This a positive step in our fight – but we’re not close to even considering claiming victory. We need this curve to meaningfully start to decline, and to do so over a sustained period of time.
983	2020-04-22 19:05:43+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 3,551 new positive #COVID19 test results, pushing our state total to 95,865. Sadly, we’ve lost an additional 314 New Jerseyans. We’ve now lost a total of 5,063 New Jerseyans to this virus.

She’s turning her sewing machine from making bandanas for our four-legged friends, to making face coverings for our two-legged heroes. She’s already donated hundreds to health care workers across Central Jersey. #NJThanksYou!
1001	2020-04-21 19:28:53+00:00	IMPORTANT: If you have dependent children and are not required to file a federal tax return – you have until noon tomorrow to register with the IRS to qualify to receive your $500-per-child stimulus payment. Visit http://IRS.gov &amp; use their new “non-filer” online tool.
1002	2020-04-21 19:28:00+00:00	A solid testing regime will be critical in our reopening strategy. We’re punching above our weight and working with all partners – including our state’s flagship university @RutgersU. But the federal government must step up in a big way here.
1003	2020-04-21 19:27:27+00:00	NEW: We’re providing much needed relief and assistance for New Jerseyans who are facing hardships in paying their private student loans, and were not eligible for relief under the CARES Act. Borrowers should contact their servicers. For more info, visit http://dobi.nj.gov.
1004	2020-04-21 19:21:37+00:00	“Many months of sacrifice and self-discipline lie ahead – months in which our patience and our will will be tested… But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing.” – President John F. Kennedy
1005	2020-04-21 19:21:14+00:00	My number one job is the health of our state. Public health leads everything. Public health creates economic health. Public health creates educational health. On this principle I will not equivocate.
1006	2020-04-21 19:20:38+00:00	We are not going to open our schools back up until we are convinced by scientists and medical professionals that doing so would be safe for students and staff – and their families. I will not rush this. I cannot.
1007	2020-04-21 19:17:43+00:00	Carole Wolf of Newark was a nurse’s aide at Hospitality House. All four of her sons are Newark firefighters, and her daughter is a nurse at Overlook Hospital. She also leaves behind 13 grandchildren and five siblings. We will keep her and her family in our thoughts.

She helped craft the health education materials and tools that Mercer County is using currently in its #COVID19 emergency response. Our hearts are with her loved ones.
1010	2020-04-21 19:13:15+00:00	LOOK: We’re seeing decreases in the number of new daily hospitalizations. This ties, almost directly, with the fact that we’re slowing the rate of spread. The fewer people who test positive, the fewer people who need to go to the hospital.
1011	2020-04-21 19:12:51+00:00	IMPORTANT: The number of patients in either critical or intensive care has been relatively stable over the past week. So has the number of ventilators in use. We want these numbers to decrease, but not seeing any significant increases is a good starting point.
1012	2020-04-21 19:11:54+00:00	UPDATE: •7,594 residents currently hospitalized with #COVID19 •1,930 #COVID19 patients in either critical or intensive care •1,501 #COVID19 patients on respirators •72 patients at our field medical stations •630 New Jerseyans discharged
1013	2020-04-21 19:11:02+00:00	We have a significant flattening of the curve. That’s not enough for us to go back to business as usual. Not by a long shot. We need to begin to see this curve finally start its decline. We must keep our social distancing policies in place for at least the next several weeks.
1014	2020-04-21 19:09:28+00:00	NEW: We have 3,643 new confirmed positive cases of #COVID19, bringing our statewide total to 92,387. Sadly, we’ve lost another 379 New Jerseyans. The loss of life due to #COVID19 related complications is now 4,753.

1017	2020-04-21 17:02:34+00:00	Just surveyed Wildwood boardwalk damage from last week’s storm with @senatortesta and Wildwood Mayor Pete Byron. There’s a lot to clean up, but we’ll get it done – together. #JerseyStrong
1018	2020-04-21 16:03:23+00:00	Toured our new field medical station at the Atlantic City Convention Center this morning. We’re expanding our health care capacity as fast as humanly possible to prepare South Jersey for a surge in #COVID19 cases. In this battle to save lives, every bed counts.

1023	2020-04-21 00:02:47+00:00	On #YomHashoah, we remember the six million Jewish men, women, and children murdered by the Nazis, alongside millions of others. Silence is an ally of evil. We all have an obligation to speak out against anti-Semitism and hate whenever and wherever we see it. #NeverAgain

1029	2020-04-20 18:50:19+00:00	Saddened by the death of former Passaic County Freeholder and North Haledon Councilman Joseph Lobosco, who dedicated his life to public service. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.
1030	2020-04-20 18:42:50+00:00	Five weeks ago, former @RHSBOYSLACROSSE standout and @BatesCollege All-American Jack Allard was confirmed positive for #COVID19. He was put on a ventilator. Last Thursday, he walked out of the hospital. For Jack and the hundreds more who have recovered, we’re optimistic.
1031	2020-04-20 18:40:37+00:00	 We NEED respiratory therapists, physicians, nurses, and paramedics. If you have experience in these positions, please visit http://covid19.nj.gov/volunteer.
1032	2020-04-20 18:39:07+00:00	On Saturday, the National Action Network distributed face coverings and pre-packaged meals to residents at the NAN Tech World campus in Newark, many of whom needed both. To @TheRevAl and Pastor Steffie Bartley – thank you for all you are doing in our communities.
1033	2020-04-20 18:38:23+00:00	We recently received an N95 mask decontamination unit from @Battelle, which is currently being set up in Edison. This will help us deal with the continued national challenges around PPE.
1034	2020-04-20 18:37:49+00:00	.@ReadyNJ has distributed more than 10 million pieces of PPE from the state stockpile that we’ve been able to put together. Over the last week alone, we moved nearly 5 million pieces – including nearly 900,000 N95 masks, 1.3 million surgical masks &amp; more than 2.6 million gloves.
1035	2020-04-20 18:34:18+00:00	Personal health creates economic health. It can’t be the other way around. It has to happen in that order.
1036	2020-04-20 18:33:52+00:00	This is a two-part scenario – securing the public health situation so you can have confidence as you get back as we reopen our economy. Right now, that confidence does not exist.
1037	2020-04-20 18:33:17+00:00	Reopening our economy today would backfire on us two-fold – a large spike in #COVID19 cases, and no customers at our stores because people are still fearful for their health and that of their kids and families.
1038	2020-04-20 18:32:28+00:00	In the coming days, I will announce the benchmarks we will need to see to reopen our state. Do not think for one minute that we’re going to be able to flip a switch and return to life as we knew it. We will be careful and we will be strategic.
1039	2020-04-20 18:32:16+00:00	Our mission is to save lives. It may be inconvenient for some, but your inconvenience pales in comparison to the 4,377 people who are now dead. My job – our collective job – is to protect the 9 million residents of our state as best as possible. For that I will not apologize.
1040	2020-04-20 18:32:12+00:00	I have not made any decision I have made over the past six weeks in a vacuum. My driving purpose has been to save lives. Period.
1041	2020-04-20 18:30:18+00:00	Ray Kenny served as Senior Vice President and General Manager Rail Operations at @NJTRANSIT. He was a key member of our team, working hard and making progress in restoring NJTRANSIT’s trains to where we know they can be, and where we need them to be. We will miss him.
1042	2020-04-20 18:29:26+00:00	Anna Gaffney was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico, and came to the mainland U.S. at the age of 13, settling in the Bronx. She was a successful business owner & a passionate advocate for those in need – and passed these values on to her children. Our prayers are with her family.
1043	2020-04-20 18:28:06+00:00	Bill Fechtmann was a longtime resident and community-member in Maywood. He served in the Army for three years. Bill was a life member of Maywood VFW Post 7408, and served as its Quartermaster. May God bless him and his family.
1044	2020-04-20 18:27:55+00:00	Ambassador Foday Mansaray was a representative of the International Human Rights Commission Relief Fund Trust and Deputy Foreign Minister and High Representative to the United Nations. He was a strong advocate for his native Sierra Leone. Our hearts are with his family.
1045	2020-04-20 18:26:28+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 177 New Jerseyans to #COVID19. We’ve now lost 4,377 precious members of our New Jersey family to this virus. We all have a role to play in losing fewer and fewer members of our New Jersey family.
1046	2020-04-20 18:26:11+00:00	IMPORTANT: The number of discharges continues to outpace the numbers from intake. We are not claiming victory, but we are making progress.
1047	2020-04-20 18:24:51+00:00	This is about saving lives. We will continue to be data-driven in our effort to save lives and to prepare for what’s to come.
1048	2020-04-20 18:23:53+00:00	The number of newly hospitalized patients is moving on a DOWNWARD TREND. This is one of our most-important positive indicators. It means that our health care system is in a better position to get ahead and stay ahead. It means that our social distancing efforts are working.
1049	2020-04-20 18:23:22+00:00	IMPORTANT: We are seeing relative stability in the number of patients in critical or intensive care.
1050	2020-04-20 18:22:05+00:00	Stats: •6,986 #COVID19 patients reported hospitalized •2,018 individuals listed in critical or intensive care •1,594 ventilators were in use •74 patients are at one of our field medical stations •583 New Jerseyans discharged
1051	2020-04-20 18:21:43+00:00	This chart shows our three-week trend in reporting new cases. We’ve achieved relative stability. This doesn’t mean we aren’t going to see some days with one-off spikes and drops. We must move away from looking at snapshot data and instead look at overall trendlines.
1052	2020-04-20 18:21:07+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 3,528 new confirmed #COVID19 test results. Our statewide total is now 88,806.
1053	2020-04-20 18:20:20+00:00	LOOK: The rates by which the numbers of new #COVID19 cases are doubling have significantly SLOWED. Just a few weeks ago, in some areas of the state cases were doubling in a matter of days. Now we’re seeing those rates slow to where we can measure them in the numbers of weeks.

1076	2020-04-18 17:15:55+00:00	This is a pandemic the likes of which we haven’t seen in a century. If you have been keeping your eyes and your mind closed to the facts and to science, please open them – WIDE – before you become one of the numbers I report here every day.
1077	2020-04-18 17:15:08+00:00	We have vaccines that can protect against the flu. We have proven anti-flu therapies. We’re at least a year away from a vaccine for #COVID19, and there are currently no proven therapies.
1078	2020-04-18 17:14:28+00:00	The hospitalization rate for #COVID19 is far greater than what it is for the flu. The general hospitalization rate for the flu is about one-tenth of 1% of cases. For #COVID19, it’s roughly 10%. You are 100 TIMES MORE LIKELY to end up in the hospital.
1079	2020-04-18 17:13:35+00:00	#COVID19 is more virulent than the flu. One person with COVID-19 can infect many, many more without showing any symptoms. Once someone is exposed, it can take a long time – as much as 14 days – to develop illness.
1080	2020-04-18 17:13:16+00:00	If you think this is “just the flu” – you are 100% wrong. In just six weeks, we’ve lost 4,070 New Jerseyans to #COVID19. That’s more than @CDCgov statistics show we’ve lost over the past three entire flu seasons COMBINED.

1083	2020-04-18 17:07:42+00:00	Edison Fire Captain Richard Campbell was a 28-year veteran firefighter. Firefighting and public service ran in his blood, as he followed his father into the line of service, as did his brother. He was a hero. We send our condolences to his wife and their four children.
1084	2020-04-18 17:07:06+00:00	Sadly, we’ve lost another 231 members of our New Jersey family. We’ve now lost a total of 4,070 blessed souls. We will do everything in our power to stop the spread of this disease and lose fewer and fewer residents to it.
1085	2020-04-18 17:06:20+00:00	Need further proof of why we must keep up with our aggressive social distancing? Look at this map – the time it is taking for cases to double across much of the state is slowing significantly.
1086	2020-04-18 17:05:56+00:00	Here are the daily number of patients in intensive and critical care over the past 21 days. Throughout the past week, we’ve seen these numbers begin to stabilize. This is why we must keep up with our aggressive social distancing.
1087	2020-04-18 17:05:19+00:00	Look at this chart: the number of new hospitalizations against the number of daily discharges. Over the past three weeks, we’ve been able to move these lines closer together to the point where we are now reporting more people leaving the hospital than entering.
1088	2020-04-18 17:04:37+00:00	Look at this chart: the daily rates of new hospitalizations since April 1st. There is a direct cause-effect relationship between this graph and the first one. The slower the rate of new cases, the slower the rate of new hospitalizations. It’s really that simple.
1089	2020-04-18 17:04:10+00:00	Look at this graph: the rate of growth of new cases over the past 21 days We are flattening the curve. This is a credit to each and every one of you who has taken to heart our aggressive social distancing measures and who continues to do your part.
1090	2020-04-18 17:03:30+00:00	As of 10:00 PM last night: •7,718 residents reported hospitalized •2,024 individuals listed in critical or intensive care •1,641 ventilators were in use •814 residents discharged 90 patients are at one of our field medical stations

1099	2020-04-17 20:11:41+00:00	Today I sent a letter to @DHSGov Acting Secretary Chad Wolf asking him to automatically extend work authorizations for DACA recipients. Nearly 5,000 of our state’s DACA recipients are essential workers on the frontlines of our fight against #COVID19. We need them more than ever.

1106	2020-04-17 17:23:30+00:00	To the millions of New Jerseyans who are with us in channeling our deep New Jersey values to defeat #COVID19 – keep up the good work. I know it hasn’t been easy or fun, but it’s absolutely essential to our success.

1111	2020-04-17 17:18:14+00:00	INCREDIBLE: More than 22,000 people have stepped up to volunteer with our health care teams fighting #COVID19. This army can always use more reinforcements. If you have prior medical experience, please go to http://covid19.nj.gov/volunteer.
1112	2020-04-17 17:16:58+00:00	BREAKING: @NewJerseyOAG, through @ConsumerNJ, will begin issuing temporary emergency licenses to foreign-licensed physicians. We're now the FIRST state to begin fully tapping the tremendous wealth of international knowledge and experience to help us on our own front lines.
1113	2020-04-17 17:15:33+00:00	This is a moral test for us all. The last thing we can do is relax and get complacent. If we do, then this map will get bright red once again. If that happens, our health care system will be swamped and countless people will die. It’s really as simple as that.
1114	2020-04-17 17:12:53+00:00	I know social distancing is hard. I know it’s not fun. I know it’s going to be a few more weeks, at least. If you want to be mad at me, go ahead. But, my number one goal – my entire focus – is on defeating this virus and getting our state back to where we can reopen.

We’ve conducted the fourth-most tests among all states. The only states which have conducted more are states with significantly larger populations.
1170	2020-04-15 17:18:30+00:00	IMPORTANT: Tomorrow, 4/16, and Friday, 4/17, only our @BergenCC testing site will be open. @PNCArtsCenter will reopen on 4/18 exclusively for symptomatic first responders and health care workers.

1171	2020-04-15 17:14:07+00:00	This is a war. Wars aren’t won by one person or one small group. They’re won when millions of people come together in a common cause. Our cause right now is totally flattening the curve, and then seeing it drop down the other side.

1173	2020-04-15 17:12:59+00:00	We’re continuing to do everything we can to prepare for the absolute worst. We’ve: Increased hospital capacity statewide by 60% Set up three field medical stations with @USACEHQ Had beds set aside for New Jerseyans on the USNS Comfort
1174	2020-04-15 17:12:27+00:00	Look at this map – we’re getting NJ lighter and lighter. The less bright orange we see, the slower the spread. That means we’re flattening the curve, which means we’re keeping people from getting #COVID19 AND lessening some of the immense strain on our health care systems.
1175	2020-04-15 17:12:08+00:00	We’ve taken among the most-aggressive positions of any state in America to slow the spread of #COVID19. We've asked you to make tremendous sacrifices with us in this fight. Some of them may seem like nuisances, but every step we've taken has been made out of sheer necessity.
1176	2020-04-15 17:10:24+00:00	Jacqueline Cruz-Towns was a family matriarch, and an enduring and constant presence in the life of her son, Karl-Anthony Towns. She spent 20 years working at @RutgersU.

1392	2020-04-08 17:16:25+00:00	This is not a situation where you go to the basement and flip the main breaker and the whole house gets powered back up. We’re going to have to go room by room, carefully and methodically, to make sure we’re doing it in a way that is smart and keeps us safe.
1393	2020-04-08 17:16:03+00:00	When the time comes that we can begin to put this emergency in the rear-view mirror, do not think that we are going to be able to get back to normal at once. It is going to take time to reopen our state in a systematic and careful way to protect against a boomerang of #COVID19.

1432	2020-04-06 21:29:17+00:00	We need all the experienced help we can get right now – from retired law enforcement officers to nurses. That's why I just signed an Executive Order allowing retirees to return to State and local government employment without impacting their retirement pensions.
1433	2020-04-06 20:34:10+00:00	Gina – we cannot thank you enough for stepping up to help New Jersey in our time of need. You are a hero. This is an all hands on deck moment – if you have prior medical experience, New Jersey NEEDS you. Please sign up to volunteer at http://covid19.nj.gov/volunteer.
1434	2020-04-06 19:59:53+00:00	Grateful to our health care workers for their selfless service, commitment, and bravery. In partnership with @HMHNewJersey, let's #LightTheFight &amp; show how much we appreciate our heroes: Hang a string of lights on your home Put lanterns or flameless candles in your windows
1435	2020-04-06 19:40:03+00:00	To all the jackasses out there who we now have to carry – get with the program. We know who you are and we will not relent until we have 100% compliance.

1442	2020-04-06 18:43:56+00:00	I cannot thank all of you who are doing the things we need you to do, in your communities, enough. We’re working as one family should – we’re looking out for each other and we’re supporting each other.
1443	2020-04-06 18:43:45+00:00	Earth Angels for Dementia is turning their focus to help those fighting #COVID19 on the front lines by providing free meals to our public health workers and first responders.

1444	2020-04-06 18:42:18+00:00	I just got off the phone with @realDonaldTrump – he granted our request for access to some of the beds on the USNS Comfort. This is a big step for us. I thank both the President and @VP.
1445	2020-04-06 18:37:30+00:00	A huge thank you to the men of @IBEW, and in particular, their state Political Director Ian Leonard, who have made a donation of much-needed PPE – N95 masks and Tyvek gloves, jackets, and booties. Thank you!
1446	2020-04-06 18:36:46+00:00	There are many more sites being run by hospitals or other private-sector partners that are not listed. If you believe you’re showing symptoms, please call your primary care practitioner right away. They can assess you & direct you where to go get a test if you meet the standard.
1447	2020-04-06 18:36:23+00:00	Across New Jersey, there are 15 other publicly-run and accessible testing sites. Visit http://covid19.nj.gov/testing for more information.
1448	2020-04-06 18:35:52+00:00	REMINDER: Tomorrow only the @BergenCC drive-through testing site will be open. @PNCArtsCenter site will be open on 4/8. Each site will open at 8:00 AM and operate until it reaches its 500 tests. You must be a NJ resident exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness to be tested.
1449	2020-04-06 18:35:23+00:00	BREAKING: Today I’m signing an Executive Order to allow retired public employees to return to work – in whichever capacity they can – to help us throughout this emergency without impacting their pension status. We need all the experienced help we can get.
1450	2020-04-06 18:35:12+00:00	Our charge to you remains the same: Keep social distancing. Keep washing your hands. Keep staying indoors. Keep being smart.
1451	2020-04-06 18:34:55+00:00	The curve is flattening. But, this is no time to spike any footballs or to take our foot off the gas. We still have a week-and-a-half to go, at least, until we hit the peak. This isn’t over – not by a long shot.
1452	2020-04-06 18:34:14+00:00	From day one, our goals have been twofold: #FlattenTheCurve and give our health care system the ability to withstand the onslaught Ensure that the PPE and equipment our front-line responders need gets to where it’s needed most efficiently and before there’s a crisis
1453	2020-04-06 18:33:03+00:00	This map shows us the zip codes where those of you using our self-assessment on http://covid19.nj.gov are reporting from. From these self-reports, we can start tracking potential hot spots and begin to assess our future equipment and PPE distribution needs.
1454	2020-04-06 18:32:24+00:00	We have a tough enough job as it is on the lower curve. We believe fully that we can make it given our rate of PPE acquisition. If you stop your social distancing, your life and the lives of our medical personnel will be in much more danger.
1455	2020-04-06 18:31:50+00:00	If we relax our social distancing, our health care system will be overrun with a surge FOUR TIMES what it could be. That would be literally disastrous. We’re already doing all we can to uncover every piece of PPE along with every ventilator we can possibly mobilize.
1456	2020-04-06 18:31:21+00:00	If we keep up with our current practices, we can get through the peak with the hospital beds that we’re preparing. If we relax our social distancing, we will overwhelm the system to the point that ALL of our contingency plans, and then some, will need to go into effect.
1457	2020-04-06 18:30:21+00:00	If we stick to the bottom curve, we get to the peak of that flatter curve much more quickly. We can then drop down the other side that much more quickly, too. The difference is literally in the 420,000+ positive cases we can prevent. This is not a game. This is life or death.
1458	2020-04-06 18:29:20+00:00	Look at this graph: Shadowed line = where we would be had we done nothing Red line = our trajectory if everyone relaxed their social distancing & stopped staying home If we continue to stay home and practice social distancing, we can stick ourselves to the bottom curve.
1459	2020-04-06 18:28:28+00:00	In real time, we’re seeing a DECLINE in the growth rate of new cases, from 24% day-over-day on March 30th, to roughly 12% today. Our efforts #FlattenTheCurve are STARTING TO PAY OFF. Our job now is to keep flattening it to the point where our day-over-day increase is ZERO.
1460	2020-04-06 18:27:27+00:00	We’ve built a strong modeling program that we can use with great – and increasing – confidence. What we can see, together, is that while we’re not anywhere close to being out of the woods yet, we’re on the right path to get there.
1461	2020-04-06 18:26:12+00:00	When we began our preparations for responding to this emergency back in January, we knew that only an objective, fact-based, moneyball approach would get us through this. This approach has shaped our aggressive stance on social distancing.
1462	2020-04-06 18:24:59+00:00	We cannot give in to fear or sadness. We must resolve to continue our fight together. To crack the back of this crisis. To #FlattenTheCurve. So we have fewer and fewer lives lost and friends to mourn.
1463	2020-04-06 18:24:35+00:00	Susan Cicala was a registered nurse for 37 years, working at both Clara Maas Medical Center and Northern State Prison. She was also a wife, mother, grandmother, aunt, and sister. Her loss will be felt by so many, and our hearts are with her family.
1464	2020-04-06 18:23:35+00:00	Daisy Doronila served as a nurse at the Hudson County Correctional Center for more than 20 years. She was a single mom, lived in Nutley, and a proud member of @district1199J. She gave tirelessly to her family and community. Our deepest condolences to her family.
1465	2020-04-06 18:22:45+00:00	Colette Lamothe-Galette dedicated her life to improving the health of New Jerseyans. A beloved former @NJDeptofHealth Deputy Commissioner, she most recently worked at @NicholsonForNJ. We mourn alongside her loved ones and @NJDeptofHealth family as they lead our #COVID19 war.
1466	2020-04-06 18:21:40+00:00	We just learned, moments ago, of the passing of @JerseyCity Councilman Michael Yun. He was a respected leader and a good man. A terrific husband, father, and grandfather. We stand with Jersey City in mourning his loss, and we send our thoughts to his family.
1467	2020-04-06 18:20:39+00:00	NEW: We’ve received 3,663 positive #COVID19 test results since yesterday, bringing the statewide total to 41,090. Sadly, we must report another 86 deaths due to #COVID19 related complications. Our statewide total has now eclipsed 1,000, and sits at 1,003.

1502	2020-04-04 17:22:09+00:00	Earlier this week, federal authorities broke up a significant PPE hoarding situation in Brooklyn, and seized hundreds of thousands of pieces of PPE. Yesterday, we learned from the @FBI and @USAO_NJ that NJ will be one of the beneficiaries of the distribution of these supplies.
1503	2020-04-04 17:21:43+00:00	We're working to expand hospital capacity by utilizing hotels & dormitories located in hot-spot areas, or in close proximity to hospitals which are nearing capacity. This is an enormous effort to brings thousands of new beds online. At every level, this is a data-driven process.
1504	2020-04-04 17:21:31+00:00	We’re adding hospital capacity as quickly as we can. We’re working with all of our hospitals to rapidly and significantly increase bed capacity. We’re building-out new wings and bringing vacated buildings back online. We’re building-out our field medical stations.
1505	2020-04-04 17:21:06+00:00	I also spoke with Jared Kushner this morning about our critical need for ventilators and PPE. We also discussed the need for flexibility for our field medical stations.
1506	2020-04-04 17:19:35+00:00	I spoke with @VP this morning about a range of critical asks, including our outstanding ask of 1,650 ventilators. I also re-expressed how important it is that @USTreasury be as flexible as possible when they take money from the CARES Act and apply it to states.
1507	2020-04-04 17:10:34+00:00	Look at this graphic from @NYTimes. Social distancing is vital to slowing the spread. By being apart, we’re actually working together.
1508	2020-04-04 17:08:06+00:00	Today, our flags are flying at half-staff in the memory of all who have been lost, and for all the families who have been impacted by #COVID19. They will continue to fly at half-staff throughout the duration of this pandemic. No family will be forgotten.

1514	2020-04-04 17:03:07+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 4,331 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our statewide total to 34,124. Another 200 New Jerseyans have passed due to #COVID19 related complications, bringing our statewide total to 846.

1536	2020-04-03 17:14:04+00:00	There is no silver bullet we can load to make this go away overnight. This is a war – and wars like this aren’t won in one day. It will take all of us, over the coming weeks, to stay disciplined in our social distancing, in our hygiene, and in using our common sense.
1537	2020-04-03 17:12:01+00:00	I know I sound like a broken record on this, but social distancing is our best offense and defense. In the absence of a vaccine, it’s our best surrogate vaccine. When you’re out, keep that safe six-foot distance between you and others. If you don’t have to be out, STAY HOME.
1538	2020-04-03 17:07:26+00:00	I'm signing an Executive Order directing that all flags across NJ be lowered to half-staff indefinitely in honor of those we have lost – and those we will lose – to #COVID19.

1548	2020-04-02 20:30:56+00:00	Hi Becca – We've procured nearly 10 million pieces of PPE for our frontline responders.

1604	2020-04-01 17:16:37+00:00	REMINDER: I’m extending the New Jersey income tax filing deadline for both individuals and businesses to July 15th. This is an automatic extension.
1605	2020-04-01 17:13:25+00:00	REMINDER: The @BergenCC drive-through site will be open tomorrow starting at 8:00 AM. @PNCArtsCenter will be closed. To get tested, you must be a New Jersey resident exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illness.
1606	2020-04-01 17:12:43+00:00	PPE items come at a significant cost to the state. But let me be clear: there is no price too high to save a life. There is no price too high to protect our health care workers and those on the front lines of this battlefield.
1607	2020-04-01 17:12:01+00:00	While every bit of federal assistance is essential, New Jersey continues to lead on its own. On our own, we’ve procured nearly 10 million pieces of PPE that are beginning to flow into our warehouses and will be allocated to the front lines.
1608	2020-04-01 17:10:38+00:00	We’ve received a total of 850 additional ventilators. But, we still need more. I will continue to press the @WhiteHouse, @fema, and anyone who I can get on the phone for more ventilators, more PPE, more direct state aid – whatever it is that we need.
1609	2020-04-01 17:08:15+00:00	Social distancing is both our best offense and best defense against #COVID19. Stay home before this hits home.
1610	2020-04-01 17:05:44+00:00	Saddened by the loss of Janice Preschel of Teaneck. Janice was the founder of the Helping Hands Food Pantry that has fed countless families for more than a decade. She was active in her temple – Temple Emeth – and was a past president of the Teaneck Rotary. She was 60 years old.
1611	2020-04-01 17:04:35+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 3,649 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our statewide total to 22,255. We’ve sadly have lost another 91 fellow New Jerseyans to #COVID19, meaning we have now lost a total of 355 members of our great and diverse New Jersey family.

1617	2020-04-01 13:35:08+00:00	BREAKING: The New Jersey state tax filing deadline WILL BE EXTENDED from April 15th to July 15th. Additionally, the state fiscal year will be extended to September 30th to allow us to focus on leading our state out of this crisis. Thank you, @SpeakerCoughlin and @NJSenatePres.
1618	2020-03-31 19:15:45+00:00	Women are doctors. Women are nurses. Women are grocery store workers. Women are child care providers. Women are heroes who are on the front lines of our #COVID19 war. They deserve equal pay for equal work. That’s why I signed the nation’s strongest equal pay law. #EqualPayDay
1619	2020-03-31 18:59:56+00:00	We’re not an average state. This is Jersey. We've lived our lives punching above our weight and defying the odds. No state has more attitude or character. We have to set a high bar – in terms of our social distancing – that no other state has set before. #FlattenTheCurve

1621	2020-03-31 17:55:43+00:00	As we continue to think about a Main Street stimulus, Congress should undo the SALT deduction cap to help New Jersey’s middle class homeowners. I thank @BillPascrell and @RepJoshG for their continued efforts on this front.

1625	2020-03-31 17:33:08+00:00	At some point, God willing sooner than later, we will break the back of this damn virus. We will flatten that curve. We will have gotten the capacity in our health care system sufficient enough to deal with the cases that we have. We will get back on our feet.
1626	2020-03-31 17:29:02+00:00	We’re doing all we can to ensure the safety of our New Jersey family. We’re doing all we can to make sure that we don’t just get through this, but that we come out of this stronger. Leave the worrying to me.
1627	2020-03-31 17:25:47+00:00	There’s already been some chatter about the next coronavirus-related bill coming out of Congress. New Jersey, and New Jerseyans who are in the eye of the storm, shouldn’t be treated the same way as states less impacted by this invisible enemy.
1628	2020-03-31 17:24:45+00:00	IMPORTANT: Residents who are eligible for unemployment will receive an additional $600 per week through July 31 because of the federal relief bills. This money should arrive starting next week for those already collecting unemployment.
1629	2020-03-31 17:24:04+00:00	We urge employers to keep your workers on payroll throughout this crisis. If you do, you will be eligible for a dollar-for-dollar payroll tax credit against those costs – this is available to 99.8 percent of all businesses in New Jersey.
1630	2020-03-31 17:23:40+00:00	Yesterday, @NewJerseyOAG announced that we'll crack down on any physician or pharmacist hoarding certain prescription drugs, or inappropriately prescribing them. Certain drugs are being investigated for their potential in treating #COVID19. We must start to protect that supply.
1631	2020-03-31 17:22:42+00:00	Proud to report we now have 100% compliance from municipal water companies voluntarily halting all service shut-offs throughout this emergency. Between both municipal and private-sector water utilities, no New Jerseyan should fear losing their access to clean water.
1632	2020-03-31 17:21:02+00:00	We appreciate every single piece of PPE we are receiving. But we need much more. I continue to push our case with the @WhiteHouse, with @fema, and with everyone I speak to. If you have PPE to donate, please let us know through http://covid19.nj.gov/ppedonations
1633	2020-03-31 17:20:29+00:00	Our current statewide PPE totals: 280,466 N-95 masks 399,440 surgical masks 150,665 gloves 50,778 gowns 74,052 face shields We’re continuing to seek out every available piece of PPE and every available ventilator.
1634	2020-03-31 17:17:15+00:00	UPDATE: Last night, we received a shipment of PPE through our partners at @fema, consisting of more than 260,000 total pieces – including masks and gloves. We continue to work every single avenue to get more equipment for our state and frontline responders.
1635	2020-03-31 17:16:31+00:00	For any New Jerseyan who thinks they may need to be tested, a good first stop is our symptom self-test at http://covid19.nj.gov. If you do believe you may be exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care practitioner.
1636	2020-03-31 17:14:07+00:00	.@camdencountynj, in partnership with Cooper University Health Care and @VirtuaHealth, will be opening a testing site tomorrow for county residents at Cooper’s Poynt Park in Camden. This site will be open from 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM each weekday through 4/15.
1637	2020-03-31 17:13:52+00:00	Ocean County opened a public testing site yesterday at @OceanEDU. This site is open M-F by appointment only for Ocean County residents who are exhibiting symptoms. For more info, please visit http://ochd.org

1640	2020-03-31 17:11:03+00:00	Tomorrow, 4/1, the @PNCArtsCenter drive-through testing site will be open at 8:00 AM for symptomatic New Jersey residents ONLY. The @BergenCC testing site will be closed tomorrow.
1641	2020-03-31 17:10:47+00:00	This isn’t about you. It’s about us. I know this isn’t fun, but now is the time be selfless. Not selfish. We all have to pull together.
1642	2020-03-31 17:09:24+00:00	Let’s help everyone on our front lines – especially the unsung and overlooked heroes like home health aides, sanitation workers, truck drivers, and transit workers – by staying home and doing our part to slow the spread of #COVID19.
1643	2020-03-31 17:05:05+00:00	One of the precious souls we lost yesterday was Passaic Firefighter Israel Tolentino, Jr. He became a firefighter just last year and had also served as an EMT. He was only 33 years old. We keep his family, and every family who has lost a loved one to coronavirus, in our prayers.
1644	2020-03-31 17:04:31+00:00	Please stay home before this hits home, like it has for 267 of our families.
1645	2020-03-31 17:04:11+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 2,196 new positive #COVID19 cases since yesterday, bringing our statewide total to 18,696. We continue to lose invaluable members of our New Jersey family to #COVID19. Since yesterday, another 69 residents have died, and that total now stands at 267.

1649	2020-03-31 14:16:45+00:00	Saddened by the death of Ben Luderer, a young baseball coach whose love of the game pushed his players to new heights. Coronavirus has taken another New Jerseyan from us far too soon. Our hearts are with his loved ones and players, both past & present.
1650	2020-03-30 23:52:54+00:00	Great talking with you, Neera. We know that robust social distancing measures and expanded testing are critical to slowing the spread of #COVID19. We’re consulting closely with experts to #FlattenTheCurve and ensure that we emerge from this stronger than ever.

1657	2020-03-30 20:07:37+00:00	A message to grocery store workers on the front lines of our battle against #COVID19: Whether you're at the loading docks, stocking shelves, dealing directly with customers, or helping residents put bags in their cars – you are vital and you are deeply appreciated. #NJThanksYou
1658	2020-03-30 19:36:47+00:00	PLEASE NOTE: We have no plans to turn our gas stations into self-serve at this time. Please DO NOT pump your own gas.
1659	2020-03-30 19:18:14+00:00	Look at these charts. We can crush the top of this curve if we ALL do our part. Stay home. We can do this. We must do this.
1660	2020-03-30 18:35:45+00:00	I will leave no stone unturned to find the ventilators we need. Lives depend on it.
1661	2020-03-30 18:33:15+00:00	The absolute number one weapon at our disposal is STAYING AT HOME. Practice social distancing. Period.
1662	2020-03-30 18:29:03+00:00	We will get through this, but we’ll get through this more quickly and stronger if everyone does their part. Don’t think that because someone else is staying in that you don’t have to. Do the smart thing, do the right thing.
1663	2020-03-30 18:27:42+00:00	 Realtors can operate and show houses to prospective buyers on a 1-on-1 basis or to immediate families. There is still a prohibition on open houses Golf courses are closed as recreational businesses

1665	2020-03-30 18:25:38+00:00	On Friday, @NJDHS announced that, over the next two months, $70 million in additional SNAP benefits – made available by the federal response bill – will be given to qualified NJ beneficiaries to help with grocery purchases. Funds will be loaded directly onto a family’s EBT card.
1666	2020-03-30 18:25:13+00:00	.@NewJerseyOAG, @NJComptroller, and @USAO_NJ have formed a joint federal-state task force to investigate &amp; prosecute misconduct including unlawful hoarding of medical supplies, price gouging, charity scams, procurement fraud, and more. To report: 866-720-5721 or disaster@leo.gov
1667	2020-03-30 18:24:11+00:00	Health care facilities may report their daily PPE inventories, ventilator inventories, and bed counts at http://report.covid19.nj.gov This reporting is mandatory.
1668	2020-03-30 18:23:31+00:00	Proud that @PNCBank has signed on to our mortgage relief plan, meaning more homeowners financially impacted by this emergency will be able to take advantage of the 90-day grace period on their mortgage payments. We urge those homeowners to work through PNC Bank.

1671	2020-03-30 18:18:32+00:00	I’m grateful to @SherwinWilliams, who reached out to me over the weekend to report they will be donating an additional 2,500 N95 masks and 1,000 gloves. If you have PPE to donate, please visit
1672	2020-03-30 18:17:13+00:00	We need more ventilators. I will continue to say those four words in every phone call I have @realDonaldTrump, @VP, and the Administration until we get them. This is real life. This is life and death.
1673	2020-03-30 18:16:46+00:00	Ventilators are our number one concern right now. The need is dire. Our hospitals are quickly running toward full ventilator capacity. We’re working with them and @fema to allow them to “co-vent” – have 2 patients connected to the same ventilator. This will buy us precious time.
1674	2020-03-30 18:14:47+00:00	I welcome anyone with prior medical experience to visit http://covid19.nj.gov/volunteer to join our frontline army against #COVID19. We’re incredibly grateful for the selflessness and patriotism of the 3,611 health care volunteers who have already stepped forward.
1675	2020-03-30 18:13:55+00:00	That’s why we’re working to reopen closed hospitals to bring online an additional 1,300+ beds. And, we’ve partnered with @USACEHQ to stand up three regional field medical stations capable of adding another 1,000 beds. We will do everything we can to get the beds we need.
1676	2020-03-30 18:13:39+00:00	We’re preparing for the eventuality that we’re going to need extra hospital beds. That’s why we’re working with our hospitals systems to expand their bed capacities in their existing facilities.
1677	2020-03-30 18:09:48+00:00	Eventually, the number of residents needing ventilators wouldn’t just far exceed the number of available ventilators, but our ENTIRE availability of beds. All this assumes that just 5% of all cases would require hospitalization, and only 1% would eventually require a ventilator.
1678	2020-03-30 18:09:37+00:00	This is the nightmare scenario – how fast #COVID19 would’ve spread across NJ w/o social distancing. We would've expected to hit our entire statewide capacity for ICU beds on Wednesday. In 10 days, we would be expecting to exhaust our entire supply of available hospital beds.
1679	2020-03-30 18:06:45+00:00	I’m heartbroken by the loss of @NJNationalGuard Captain Douglas Linn Hickok to coronavirus. He was a drilling guardsman and physician’s assistant, originally from Jackson. Our thoughts are with his wife, children, and their family.
1680	2020-03-30 18:04:28+00:00	I’m saddened to report we’ve lost another 37 New Jerseyans to #COVID19 related complications. We've now lost 198 New Jerseyans to #COVID19. These numbers never get easier to report. But I shudder to think about what these numbers would be without our social distancing measures.
1681	2020-03-30 18:04:18+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 3,347 new positive #COVID19 cases since yesterday, bringing our statewide total to 16,636.

1683	2020-03-30 16:39:27+00:00	Just spoke with @realDonaldTrump, @VP, Dr. Debbie Birx, @WhiteHouse officials, and fellow governors during our #COVID19 video call. While I am thankful to the President for the latest shipment of ventilators – we need more and I will not stop until we get the support we need.
1684	2020-03-30 15:59:08+00:00	After multiple conversations with the @WhiteHouse, we just received word that 300 ventilators are on their way to New Jersey from the national stockpile. Ventilators are our number one need right now. I won’t stop fighting for the equipment we need to save every life we can.

1686	2020-03-30 14:00:49+00:00	Today is #NationalDoctorsDay. In times of crisis, like right now, doctors sacrifice their own health to provide care for people they've never met before. Their selflessness saves lives while reminding us that our nation is at its best when we all look out for one another.
1687	2020-03-29 21:15:41+00:00	Our most pressing medical need right now in the fight against #COVID19 is MORE VENTILATORS. That’s our number one ask and our number one need. If you have ventilators to donate, please visit: https://covid19.nj.gov/ppedonations

1693	2020-03-29 16:02:42+00:00	The @CDCgov’s travel advisory does NOT change the rules that we’ve been living under for the past week. The stay-at-home order is still in effect, and social distancing is key. For New Jerseyans, our lives shouldn’t change. If you don’t have to be out, we need you to STAY IN.
1694	2020-03-29 14:41:55+00:00	A message to health care workers on the front lines of our battle against #COVID19: THANK YOU for your selfless service, commitment to the people under you care, and for showing us what New Jersey values are about. I will keep fighting to get you the gear you need. #NJThanksYou
1695	2020-03-29 02:16:05+00:00	I encourage all New Jerseyans to continue practicing aggressive social distancing and take personal responsibility to help us get through this public health emergency.
1696	2020-03-29 02:16:05+00:00	If you have been working as part of our frontline response effort, from health care workers to supermarket workers, we still need you on the job.
1697	2020-03-29 02:16:05+00:00	To be clear, this non-binding advisory guidance does not change the rules that have been established and in place for over a week now under Executive Order 107.
1698	2020-03-29 02:16:04+00:00	Throughout the day, I’ve been in constant communication with the @WhiteHouse, including discussions with @realDonaldTrump and @VP, who briefed me on tonight’s @CDCgov travel advisory affecting the tri-state region.
1699	2020-03-29 01:49:26+00:00	A great Saturday night – ordered takeout with the family from Buona Sera in Red Bank and now we’re binging the Bourne movies. Please remember to support your local restaurants if you can, and most importantly STAY HOME.
1700	2020-03-28 23:41:44+00:00	Great call with my old friend and former @WhiteHouse Ebola Response Coordinator @RonaldKlain. We know that aggressive changes in human behavior will help bend the #COVID19 curve. We’re consulting closely with experts like Ron to help guide our decision-making.
1701	2020-03-28 21:01:36+00:00	No family should lose their home during the #COVID19 crisis. That’s why we’ve secured support from @Citi, @Chase, @usbank, @WellsFargo, @BankofAmerica, and 40 other financial institutions for a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments.

1702	2020-03-28 19:50:14+00:00	Can’t believe I have to say this at all, let alone for the second time. But here we are. NO CORONA PARTIES. They’re illegal, dangerous, and stupid. We will crash your party. You will pay a big fine. And we will name & shame you until EVERYONE gets this message into their heads.
1703	2020-03-28 18:24:46+00:00	As of 1:30 PM, #COVID19 statewide stats: • Positive Tests: 11,124 • Deaths: 140 For updates:
1704	2020-03-28 18:24:46+00:00	• Mercer: 168 • Middlesex: 808 • Monmouth: 781 • Morris: 442 • Ocean: 624 • Passaic: 608 • Salem: 3 • Somerset: 258 • Sussex: 81 • Union: 742 • Warren: 51 • Under Investigation: 2,478
1705	2020-03-28 18:24:45+00:00	We have 2,289 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our total to 11,124. • Atlantic: 17 • Bergen: 1,838 • Burlington: 115 • Camden: 123 • Cumberland: 11 • Cape May: 7 • Essex: 1,086 • Gloucester: 51 • Hudson: 771 • Hunterdon: 61
1706	2020-03-28 17:41:05+00:00	We're thankful to our federal partners for their support. New Jersey is in the epicenter of the #COVID19 pandemic and we'll keep working to get more of the PPE we need to keep New Jerseyans safe.
1707	2020-03-28 17:41:00+00:00	Following conversations with @realDonaldTrump and @VP, we received a critical shipment of PPE from the federal stockpile last night: 120,000 N95 masks 287,000 surgical masks 62,000+ face shields 51,000+ surgical gloves 3,500+ coveralls 368,000+ pairs of gloves 1,000 medical beds
1708	2020-03-28 17:28:35+00:00	We're all in this together, as one New Jersey family. We may be apart right now, but we're all together. We're united in our fight. We're pulling our family through this together. That, in every sense, is social solidarity. So, New Jersey, keep practicing your social solidarity.
1709	2020-03-28 17:28:02+00:00	We are, by our nature, a social species. Staying apart from our friends and neighbors, and even our families, is not human nature. But doing so right now is critically important for us to #FlattenTheCurve, and to emerge from this emergency stronger than ever before.
1710	2020-03-28 17:27:02+00:00	So much of what we get from Washington is determined by the Census. We know we were undercounted in 2010, and because of that, we’re leaving critical federal aid on the table right now. Please take a moment and make sure you are counted in the Census. http://2020Census.gov
1711	2020-03-28 17:26:43+00:00	The federal bill @realDonaldTrump signed last night is a welcome first step in helping New Jersey make it through this emergency. But it is not nearly enough. We will undoubtedly need more. I’ll keep working alongside our federal delegation and my fellow governors to get more.
1712	2020-03-28 17:21:17+00:00	This order includes licensed acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, and temporary medical facilities. @ReadyNJ has the ability to make additions or clarifications to they list. We're establishing a process that allows this information to be uploaded quickly and easily.
1713	2020-03-28 17:20:55+00:00	This reporting will allow us to more efficiently and effectively manage the flow of PPE, and to have the most up-to-date data possible regarding our bed capacity. Most importantly, this will help us meet the needs of our #COVID19 patients.
1714	2020-03-28 17:20:24+00:00	BREAKING: Today I will sign an Executive Order requiring designated health care facilities to report daily data on their PPE inventory, bed capacity, and ventilators to @ReadyNJ and @NJDeptofHealth.
1715	2020-03-28 17:19:05+00:00	 New Jersey DESPERATELY NEEDS PPE This includes N95 masks, gloves, face shields, and more. If you have PPE to donate, please visit
1716	2020-03-28 17:18:38+00:00	The other day we gave our municipal water utilities a deadline to halt shutoffs. With very few exceptions, we have received their cooperations. To the holdouts – you can expect a phone call from us in short order. I can assure you it will not be a pleasant conversation.
1717	2020-03-28 17:17:53+00:00	To every landlord – now is a time to show some compassion, and to work with your renters to ensure they stay safe. You cannot evict anyone at this time. If you try to, we’re not going to take that lightly, and we will make an example out of you for violating the law.
1718	2020-03-28 17:17:04+00:00	If you need rental assistance, I urge you to visit http://covid19.nj.gov and do a quick search for “rental assistance.” You will see a link to the resources available through @NJDCA.
1719	2020-03-28 17:16:50+00:00	To any renter facing eviction, let me be clear – under an executive order your landlord cannot kick you out of your home during this emergency. For any landlord who is getting mortgage relief today – we expect you will in turn provide similar relief to your tenants.
1720	2020-03-28 17:16:23+00:00	I urge, and expect, our financial institutions and credit card companies to do the right thing in all areas of their businesses. That also means lowering credit card interest rates to reflect the reality many families are living, to waive late fees, and exercise compassion.
1721	2020-03-28 17:15:09+00:00	Together, a 90-day grace period and a moratorium of foreclosures and evictions means many New Jersey families can breathe easier, keep their heads above water, and have a place they can continue to call home.
1722	2020-03-28 17:14:56+00:00	These financial institutions have also committed to not initiating foreclosure cases or eviction proceedings for at least 60 days.
1723	2020-03-28 17:13:59+00:00	This grace period CANNOT and WILL NOT be used to downgrade anyone’s credit rating. Lenders will also waive any late fees, or other costs which would otherwise arise, because of this 90-day grace period.
1724	2020-03-28 17:13:29+00:00	BREAKING: Working with @Citi, @Chase, @usbank, @WellsFargo, @BankofAmerica, and 40 other financial institutions, I’m announcing a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments for borrowers economically impacted by the #COVID19 outbreak.
1725	2020-03-28 17:12:27+00:00	This testing will be by appointment only, and you must first be pre-screened via a telehealth interview with a doctor. That process is now open and available at http://newbridgehealth.org.
1726	2020-03-28 17:12:20+00:00	Tomorrow @NewBridgeMedCtr in Paramus will provide drive-through testing for symptomatic health care workers and first responders who live or work in Bergen County.
1727	2020-03-28 17:10:33+00:00	REMINDER: Tomorrow, 3/29, only the @BergenCC testing site will be open. Testing will begin at 8:00 AM and continue until 500 samples have been taken. On Monday, 3/30, only the @PNCArtsCenter site will be open, at 8:00 AM and will be capped at 500 samples.
1728	2020-03-28 17:08:12+00:00	Last night, Ewing Township Police broke up a party with 47 people – including a DJ – crammed into a 550-square foot apartment. The organizer was charged, as they should have been and deserved to be. This is not a game. Stay home. Be smart.
1729	2020-03-28 17:07:54+00:00	No one is getting graded on a curve for their social distancing. This isn’t about whether you get an A, or a B-, or whatever. This is pass-fail. This is life and death.
1730	2020-03-28 17:07:37+00:00	Over the past day, another 32 of our fellow New Jerseyans have died because of #COVID19 related complications. This is a total of 140 invaluable and unexpendable souls who are no longer with us because of this virus.
1731	2020-03-28 17:06:16+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 2,289 new positive #COVID19 test results since yesterday, bringing our total to 11,124. We are now into the five digits. That, in and of itself, should be enough of a reason to continue your social distancing.
1732	2020-03-28 17:03:47+00:00	Holding a COVID-19 briefing. WATCH:
1733	2020-03-28 16:58:39+00:00	Saddened by the death of Newark native Mark Blum, a talented stage and screen actor. #COVID19 has taken another New Jerseyan from us too soon, and our thoughts are with his family, friends, and so many fans.
1734	2020-03-28 15:21:30+00:00	Join me live today at 1:00 PM for our daily briefing on #COVID19 in New Jersey. YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/njgovernorsoffice Twitter: https://twitter.com/GovMurphy Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/governorphilmurphy
1735	2020-03-28 14:10:32+00:00	Today, I also announced a $140 million pre-payment to health care providers to support #COVID19 preparations. This funding will assist with: Workforce demands Supplies Medications https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200328a.shtml
1736	2020-03-28 14:10:31+00:00	BREAKING: The New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority has approved a $6 million emergency loan program for our health care organizations in their fight against #COVID19. Yet another great example of our state agencies pitching in to help during this crisis.
1737	2020-03-28 02:00:57+00:00	Spoke this afternoon with @realDonaldTrump, who told me he would approve my request for use of @NationalGuard forces in New Jersey under Title 32. Grateful to our brave men and women in uniform for their support in the war against #COVID19.
1738	2020-03-28 01:12:41+00:00	Remember: We may be apart, but you are not alone. If you're feeling down, or you or a loved one feel unsafe: Crisis Text Line: text “NJ” to 741741 Family Helpline: 1-800-843-5437 Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-572-7233 Mental Health Hotline: 866-202-4357
1739	2020-03-27 23:05:01+00:00	Every decision I make during the #COVID19 emergency is based on: Data Science Medicine Facts That's how we keep New Jerseyans safe. That's how we win this war.
1740	2020-03-27 23:02:11+00:00	So glad Dr. James Pruden is on the road to recovery after being diagnosed with coronavirus. We are beyond grateful to him and all of our frontline health care workers who put their lives on the line each and every day to save ours. #JerseyStrong
1741	2020-03-27 22:47:06+00:00	The CARES Act provides critical relief, but we NEED even more federal support to ensure our states’ survivals, let alone our nation’s. We are all Americans, and the time is now for us to come together. My @nytopinion op-ed with @MassGovernor:
1742	2020-03-27 20:46:45+00:00	Our diversity is what makes New Jersey great. It’s what makes us resilient. Those values – deeply embedded in our DNA – are what will get us through this. Not resorting to racism and scapegoating.
1743	2020-03-27 20:02:21+00:00	New Jersey is the most extraordinary state because we’re the most diverse state in America and we are as together as any other state in America as one family. We will get through this.
1744	2020-03-27 19:56:23+00:00	As of 1:30 PM, #COVID19 statewide stats: • Positive Tests: 8,825 • Deaths: 108 For updates:
1745	2020-03-27 19:56:23+00:00	• Mercer: 131 • Middlesex: 640 • Monmouth: 634 • Morris: 391 • Ocean: 484 • Passaic: 484 • Salem: 3 • Somerset: 222 • Sussex: 65 • Union: 519 • Warren: 38 • Under Investigation: 1,984
1746	2020-03-27 19:56:23+00:00	We have 1,982 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our total to 8,825. • Atlantic: 14 • Bergen: 1,505 • Burlington: 88 • Camden: 95 • Cumberland: 9 • Cape May: 7 • Essex: 826 • Gloucester: 40 • Hudson: 594 • Hunterdon: 52
1747	2020-03-27 19:05:02+00:00	As grave as this moment is, it’s reaching deep into our souls, calling out our better angels, and reminding us of our common humanity. We’re coming together like never before. Once this crisis has passed, let’s let this spirit continue to guide us.
1748	2020-03-27 19:02:58+00:00	I’m a member of @AARP. The lives of our seniors are not expendable. We will do everything we can to protect them during our war against #COVID19.
1749	2020-03-27 18:21:35+00:00	REMINDER: all businesses and non-hospital health care facilities in possession of PPE that they're not using for critical health care services have until 5:00 PM TODAY to submit inventory info to us. This reporting was ordered. I expect full compliance.
1750	2020-03-27 18:20:39+00:00	New Jersey NEEDS PPE equipment – including N95 masks and gloves. If you have PPE to donate, please reach out to us through
1751	2020-03-27 18:19:34+00:00	Retired nurses or doctors, nursing and medical students, EMTs, former members of our Armed Services’ medical corps – if you have the training, WE NEED YOU. If you’re willing to join our fight, please go to http://covid19.nj.gov/volunteer to sign up.
1752	2020-03-27 18:19:27+00:00	 Today I’m putting out a call for volunteers with qualified medical training and experience who wish to join our fight against #COVID19. This isn’t just for New Jersey residents, either – we are looking across our nation for help.
1753	2020-03-27 18:18:41+00:00	.@NJSP personnel and Meadowlands Exposition Center staff and union contractors are unloading the first 250 bed field medical station on the site as we speak.
1754	2020-03-27 18:18:17+00:00	We’re continuing to work with our Level 1 hospital system and @USACEHQ to stand up three medical field stations – at the Meadowlands Convention Center in Secaucus, the New Jersey Convention Center in Edison, and the Atlantic City Convention Center.
1755	2020-03-27 18:13:40+00:00	If you see non-essential business which continues operating in violation of my orders, please reach out to us at http://covid19.nj.gov/violation
1756	2020-03-27 18:13:31+00:00	Businesses must do everything they can to provide protections against the spread of #COVID19. Social distancing is especially important. No one should be expected to go to work if they are sick.
1757	2020-03-27 18:13:21+00:00	We’re still hearing too many reports of essential businesses that are failing to implement social distancing. This is especially crucial for our warehouse and manufacturing personnel, who are on the front lines of our supply chains.
1758	2020-03-27 18:11:21+00:00	We’re providing all essential retail businesses with further guidance for ensuring social distancing within their stores while they remain open. Essential retail businesses – please review this guidance at http://covid19.nj.gov and apply these practices in your establishments.
1759	2020-03-27 18:10:42+00:00	I know we’re coming into spring, and the weather is nice to get outside for a walk or a run. But, as you do, it is essential that you practice social distancing. You can still spread coronavirus while doing healthy activities! So keeping that six-foot distance is critical.
1760	2020-03-27 18:09:41+00:00	On Sunday, 3/29, only @BergenCC will be open. They will be able to test 500 people starting at 8:00 AM. On Monday, 3/30, only @PNCArtsCenter will be open, again at 8:00 am and for 500 tests.
1761	2020-03-27 18:08:40+00:00	REMINDER: Tomorrow both the @BergenCC and @PNCArtsCenter drive-through sites will be reserved for symptomatic health care workers and first responders with valid credentials ONLY.
1762	2020-03-27 18:07:07+00:00	The fact that we have among – if not the – the highest positivity rates is a good thing, and shows we are using our limited resources to their highest and best use.
1763	2020-03-27 18:06:58+00:00	AGAIN: Our best metric for ensuring that our testing resources are being properly disbursed – and that our greater medical resources are being put to their best and highest use – comes from testing the right people, those who are symptomatic.
1764	2020-03-27 18:06:33+00:00	Testing the “worried well” and the asymptomatic would be an inappropriate use of our testing supplies, an unnecessary stress on our labs, and would not provide us with the critical data we need to get out in front, and stay out in front.
1765	2020-03-27 18:06:00+00:00	The metric that everyone MUST be focused on is the rate of positive tests among symptomatic individuals. Quite frankly, attempting to test every single person would give us data that, in the context of fighting a pandemic, would be useless.
1766	2020-03-27 18:05:26+00:00	So much of our chance for success in ending the #COVID19 emergency relies on expanding testing. We have the lab capacity in New Jersey, and we’ve taken concrete steps to increase our specimen-collection capacity. This is an all-hands-on-deck process.
1767	2020-03-27 18:04:50+00:00	I have authorized the advanced payment of more than $140 million to our health care providers to ready them for #COVID19 related expenses, including from our active efforts to significantly and immediately expand their capacity.
1768	2020-03-27 18:03:37+00:00	This isn’t easy on any of us. These aren’t abstract numbers. These are our family, our friends, our neighbors. All of us, we’re in this together, and we mourn together.
1769	2020-03-27 18:03:30+00:00	My thoughts are also with all the men and women in our hospitals working valiantly to save lives. I can only imagine the emotional toll on them, too, when they lose a patient.
1770	2020-03-27 18:03:00+00:00	We’ve lost another 27 of our fellow New Jerseyans to #COVID19 related complications. We’ve now lost a total of 108 precious lives. We mourn with these families and, indeed, with our entire state, every precious life lost.
1771	2020-03-27 18:02:20+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 1,982 new positive #COVID19 test results since yesterday, bringing our total to 8,825.
1772	2020-03-27 18:00:29+00:00	Holding a COVID-19 briefing. WATCH LIVE:
1773	2020-03-27 17:58:06+00:00	#JerseyStrong Every day. Every hour. Every minute.
1774	2020-03-27 17:55:24+00:00	As part our Main Street Stimulus focus, @NewJerseyEDA approved an initial $75 million program to help stabilize our small businesses. This isn’t just about supporting our business owners. It’s about supporting the men and women who work for them. Info: https://cv.business.nj.gov
1775	2020-03-27 17:51:09+00:00	These are ruff times, but here’s something that made me smile today – @SeeingEyeInc has named one of their puppies “Phil” after me! I was so proud to sign legislation earlier this year designating Seeing Eye dogs as our official State Dog. 
1776	2020-03-27 17:30:58+00:00	Franny McManimon was a giant in Mercer County. He was quick with a smile, an effective legislator, and never forgot the importance of mentoring those who would carry on the work of public service. His was a life well lived. All who knew and loved him are in my thoughts.
1777	2020-03-27 16:12:23+00:00	Join me live today at 2:00 PM for our daily briefing on #COVID19 in New Jersey. YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/njgovernorsoffice Twitter: https://twitter.com/GovMurphy Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/governorphilmurphy
1778	2020-03-27 14:49:35+00:00	Ordered takeout last night with the family from two of our favorite local restaurants (big families will understand) – Birravino and Muang Thai. Getting takeout and delivery is one of the best – and most delicious – ways we can all help support our local businesses right now.
1779	2020-03-27 13:38:12+00:00	Our community-based #COVID19 testing site at @PNCArtsCenter is OPEN and still has capacity to test more people today. To be eligible for testing, you must be: A current NJ resident Experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness
1780	2020-03-27 13:37:36+00:00	Shout out to these Jersey girls for keeping the team spirit alive while helping us #FlattenTheCurve. Stay healthy and I’ll see you all on the court again soon! #JerseyStrong
1781	2020-03-27 13:32:52+00:00	I also reassaured Ambassador Lee that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our growing Korean community in New Jersey – especially in the face of scapegoating during this emergency. Korean Americans are a pivotal part of our state's diverse fabric.
1782	2020-03-27 13:32:52+00:00	Yesterday I spoke with Ambassador Lee about South Korea's aggressive social distancing measures, whose success stands as an example of how such policies can truly help us get out ahead, and stay ahead, of #COVID19.
1783	2020-03-27 01:55:58+00:00	 Any business, non-hospital health care facility, or institution of higher learning in possession of PPE, ventilators, respirators, or anesthesia machines must submit that information by 5:00 PM TOMORROW. To submit: http://covid19.nj.gov/ppereport We NEED PPE to win this fight.
1784	2020-03-27 01:16:56+00:00	Call or message your neighbors, friends, and family to check in – especially the elderly and the vulnerable. See if they need anything. Help however you can. We’re one New Jersey family and we have to look out for each other. #JerseyStrong
1785	2020-03-26 23:06:05+00:00	We win wars when we don’t panic, but when we get smart, aggressive, and proactive. We win when we don’t turn on each other, but we come together. We win when we show courage. We are doing that. We will continue to do that. We will win this war as we have won so many before.
1786	2020-03-26 20:55:07+00:00	That’s me 
1787	2020-03-26 20:33:20+00:00	Scapegoating, bullying, or vilification of any community is completely unacceptable – today or ever. There is a special place in hell for the small minority that do this during this crisis.
1788	2020-03-26 20:25:27+00:00	This is what #JerseyStrong is all about. THANK YOU!
1789	2020-03-26 19:49:53+00:00	Regardless of how you worship, your ethnicity or race, who you love, your gender – we are one family. We rise and fall as one family. That’s a reality in a peaceful time, but we’re at war right now and need each other more than ever.
1790	2020-03-26 19:42:39+00:00	As of 1:30 PM, #COVID19 statewide stats: • Positive Tests: 6,876 • Deaths: 81 For updates:
1791	2020-03-26 19:42:39+00:00	• Mercer: 111 • Middlesex: 505 • Monmouth: 501 • Morris: 315 • Ocean: 389 • Passaic: 399 • Salem: 2 • Somerset: 179 • Sussex: 49 • Union: 432 • Warren: 31 • Under Investigation: 1,478
1792	2020-03-26 19:42:39+00:00	We have 2,492 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our total to 6,876. • Atlantic: 10 • Bergen: 1,206 • Burlington: 64 • Camden: 73 • Cumberland: 4 • Cape May: 6 • Essex: 609 • Gloucester: 33 • Hudson: 441 • Hunterdon: 39
1793	2020-03-26 19:00:22+00:00	Anybody who has a “corona party” in New Jersey – we will crash your party. And you will pay a big price for that. Stay home. Be smart.
1794	2020-03-26 18:25:15+00:00	Our New Jersey values – especially our diversity – are the glue that holds this family together, and it’s what will define our response and our resilience. To everyone in New Jersey, keep doing the things you’re doing to protect this family. We will make it.
1795	2020-03-26 18:24:21+00:00	Every community in New Jersey is taking its role in this emergency with the utmost seriousness and gravity. We are one family, period. And we will get through this as one family.
1796	2020-03-26 18:22:47+00:00	I take great offense when a small group of people take to social media to scapegoat others who worship differently, or look different, from them for what we’re experiencing now. That’s not only wrong in a moral and ethical sense, it’s just simply wrong on any factual basis.
1797	2020-03-26 18:20:25+00:00	REMINDER: We’ve launched a jobs portal to help residents who have lost their jobs as a result of #COVID19 find and apply for a new job on our front line response team. There are more than 35,000 job openings. Visit: https://jobs.covid19.nj.gov
1798	2020-03-26 18:17:53+00:00	The majority of New Jerseyans work for small businesses. This isn’t just about supporting our small- and midsize-business owners. It’s also about supporting the men and women who work for them. Our recovery begins with our small businesses. More info:
1799	2020-03-26 18:17:34+00:00	As part our our Main Street Stimulus focus, @NewJerseyEDA approved an initial $75 million program to help stabilize our small businesses. This program will be able to provide direct financial assistance and support for, we believe, between 3,000 and 5,000 small businesses.
1800	2020-03-26 18:16:18+00:00	If you have PPE you wish to donate, please reach out to us at
1801	2020-03-26 18:15:52+00:00	We’ve created an online form for businesses and non-hospital health care facilities in possession of PPE not required for the provision of critical health care services to submit info about their inventory. Info must be submitted by 5:00 P.M. tomorrow.
1802	2020-03-26 18:15:35+00:00	We’re continuing to move aggressively to build-out our hospital capacity. I’ve continued my push with the federal government for the supplies we will need from the national strategic stockpile: 4,500,000 N95s masks 2,500 ventilators Everything in-between
1803	2020-03-26 18:14:08+00:00	This is also why I signed legislation yesterday to expand our Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance programs to provide more workers with access to paid leave benefits during public health emergencies.
1804	2020-03-26 18:14:08+00:00	We got a real gut-punch this morning with the release of the federal unemployment numbers. In NJ, 155,000 workers filed for unemployment – 16 times the number who filed the week before. This makes federal assistance to backstop our state unemployment system even more critical.
1805	2020-03-26 18:12:25+00:00	I’m not going to stop pushing for more federal assistance for New Jersey. This bill is but a first step in the right direction, but we will need billions more, and I will keep working with my fellow governors, and our respective delegations.
1806	2020-03-26 18:12:25+00:00	We’re working around the clock with our federal delegation to get a full accounting of what, and how much, is in the federal stimulus bill for our state and our families. l must reiterate – we will need more assistance.
1807	2020-03-26 18:09:28+00:00	Starting Saturday, 4/4, and every Saturday to follow, @PNCArtsCenter will be dedicated to symptomatic health care workers and first responders with valid credentials only.
1808	2020-03-26 18:09:28+00:00	TESTING UPDATE: On Saturday, 3/28, our #COVID19 testing sites at @BergenCC and @PNCArtsCenter will accept ONLY symptomatic health care workers and first responders. Beginning Sunday, 3/29, the sites will move to a new schedule, which will be posted on http://covid19.nj.gov.
1809	2020-03-26 18:07:15+00:00	The decision to reopen will be based on careful discussion with our public health and safety experts, and with our educators and districts. We will be guided by the facts on the ground.
1810	2020-03-26 18:07:03+00:00	Let me be clear: The decision to reopen school districts rests with me. We will not be prepared to revisit the closure until at least April 17th, at the very earliest.
1811	2020-03-26 18:05:35+00:00	Please continue to follow our stay-at-home directive. Lives depend on you doing the smart thing and the right thing.
1812	2020-03-26 18:04:19+00:00	This isn’t a one day or a two day thing. #COVID19 can take up to two weeks to incubate. It’s going to take several weeks, at least, for us to begin seeing a real impact from the social distancing measures we have put into place.
1813	2020-03-26 18:04:12+00:00	Coronavirus doesn’t spread on its own. It spreads person-to-person. The more you stay home – unless we absolutely need you in our response efforts – the slower the spread, and the flatter the curve gets.
1814	2020-03-26 18:03:15+00:00	I am sad to report that another 19 New Jerseyans have now died from #COVID19 related complications. This brings that total to 81. Every single one of them was an invaluable member of our New Jersey family, and we mourn them as one family.
1815	2020-03-26 18:02:56+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 2,492 new positive #COVID19 test results since yesterday, bringing our statewide total to 6,876. This includes 436 positive tests from our mass-testing sites.
1816	2020-03-26 17:59:20+00:00	Holding a COVID-19 briefing. WATCH:
1817	2020-03-26 17:36:05+00:00	I also thanked @realDonaldTrump for the federal stimulus bill – a critical step in the right direction toward providing relief for our state and our families. We will keep working with our federal partners to #FlattenTheCurve and ensure we emerge stronger from this emergency.
1818	2020-03-26 17:36:04+00:00	Just participated in a #COVID19 video call with @realDonaldTrump, @VP, Dr. Debbie Birx, @WhiteHouse officials, and fellow governors, where I thanked the President for approving our major disaster declaration application.
1819	2020-03-26 17:11:04+00:00	Join me live today at 2:00 PM for our daily briefing on #COVID19 in New Jersey. YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/njgovernorsoffice Twitter: https://twitter.com/GovMurphy Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/governorphilmurphy
1820	2020-03-26 16:59:19+00:00	BREAKING: @NewJerseyEDA has approved a suite of new programs to support Main Street during #COVID19. These new programs are critical step to helping workers and businesses weather the storm and come out stronger when things return to normal. https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200326b.shtml
1821	2020-03-26 15:12:25+00:00	BREAKING: We've received a Major Disaster Declaration for New Jersey. We will now have access to greater essential federal support to help us through the #COVID19 emergency. I'm grateful to @realDonaldTrump, @VP, and @fema for their support of our response &amp; recovery efforts.
1822	2020-03-26 14:51:00+00:00	We’re deeply grateful to @LOrealUSA, who will be donating a significant amount of hand sanitizer, lotions, and masks to New Jersey. These supplies will help keep our communities safe and assist those on the front lines.
1823	2020-03-26 14:22:19+00:00	Saddened by the death of Chef Floyd Cardoz – a pioneering chef whose restaurant Tabla gained international recognition for its unique style and flavors. Coronavirus has taken another New Jerseyan from us too soon. Our prayers are with his friends & family.
1824	2020-03-26 13:33:56+00:00	To every nurse on the front lines of the #COVID19 crisis – we cannot thank you enough for everything you’re doing. The best thing we can all do to support them is STAY HOME.
1825	2020-03-26 13:31:54+00:00	We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to everyone working around the clock at our local health departments to help #FlattenTheCurve. I’m grateful, but not surprised, to see these New Jerseyans stepping up in our communities. #JerseyStrong
1826	2020-03-26 02:10:10+00:00	Grateful for @Merck’s donation of 300,000 masks to @ReadyNJ. Combatting #COVID19 requires that all sectors and individuals contribute to the response, and these masks will be put to use immediately by our health care professionals on the front lines.
1827	2020-03-26 02:09:14+00:00	Our hearts go out to the family, friends, and loved ones of John Cofrancesco. May his lifetime of service to the elderly inspire us to continue looking out for the most vulnerable during this emergency.
1828	2020-03-26 01:24:48+00:00	I just signed legislation to expand NJ's Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance programs during public health emergencies. No one should have to decide between taking care of themselves or a sick family member and going to work during the #COVID19 pandemic.
1829	2020-03-25 22:42:10+00:00	Some have suggested that lives are expendable. Let me be clear: We will fight to save EVERY SINGLE LIFE and we will leave no one behind in this fight. That is America. That is what we stand for. That is our value system.
1830	2020-03-25 20:09:29+00:00	As of 1:30 PM, #COVID19 statewide stats: • Positive Tests: 4,402 • Deaths: 62 For updates:
1831	2020-03-25 20:09:28+00:00	• Mercer: 82 • Middlesex: 316 • Monmouth: 313 • Morris: 223 • Ocean: 222 • Passaic: 255 • Salem: 1 • Somerset: 117 • Sussex: 27 • Union: 262 • Warren: 18 • Under Investigation: 933
1832	2020-03-25 20:09:28+00:00	We have 736 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our total to 4,402. • Atlantic: 9 • Bergen: 819 • Burlington: 48 • Camden: 61 • Cumberland: 3 • Cape May: 4 • Essex: 381 • Gloucester: 23 • Hudson: 260 • Hunterdon: 25
1833	2020-03-25 18:44:56+00:00	There’s no single family in any other state that can come close to the unity that we find in our New Jersey family. We're all in this together and we will pull through this together. #JerseyStrong
1834	2020-03-25 18:44:10+00:00	I understand that this is not fun. I understand that you can get restless. I recognize that there is impatience. But, this is much more likely to be a marathon than a sprint. We all must persevere in order for us to come out stronger on the other side of this emergency.
1835	2020-03-25 18:43:39+00:00	REMINDER: Our social distancing directives are not polite suggestions. They’ve been ordered to protect the greater public health and safety, and to give us a better chance of slowing the spread of #COVID19. We will enforce these.
1836	2020-03-25 18:43:18+00:00	We’re going to do everything we can. We will leave no stone unturned. We will remain on the battlefield to the last second to make sure that we save as many lives as we can and prevent as many people from getting sick as we can.
1837	2020-03-25 18:26:19+00:00	Please take to heart the need to follow the social distancing protocols and rules we’ve put in place. They’re there for a reason: To #FlattenTheCurve To cut off the surge To allow our health care system to manage the cases that are already out there
1838	2020-03-25 18:24:49+00:00	REMINDER: my work-from-home order is NOT a polite suggestion. Everyone needs to follow this order. If you see a business operation in violation of my executive order, or are working at one, please report them at http://covid19.nj.gov/violation
1839	2020-03-25 18:21:17+00:00	We’ve learned that @HHSGov has awarded $1.9 million to help 24 health centers in New Jersey address screening and testing needs, acquire medical supplies, and boost telehealth capacity. We’re greatly appreciative for this funding.
1840	2020-03-25 18:19:51+00:00	I had a good conversation with @VP this morning regarding our request for a disaster declaration, and I am hopeful for a positive outcome.
1841	2020-03-25 18:17:55+00:00	I thank our Congressional Delegation, especially @SenatorMenendez and @SenBooker, for their efforts in this. Let me be clear: This direct assistance for states is a strong first step, but we will need more help and I will continue to push for more help.
1842	2020-03-25 18:16:53+00:00	I spent a tremendous amount of time and energy last week burning up the phone lines to the @WhiteHouse – to @realDonaldTrump and @VP directly – and the Congressional Leadership fighting tooth-and-nail for direct financial aid to New Jersey.
1843	2020-03-25 18:16:39+00:00	We’re looking closely at the federal legislation that is currently before the Senate. I’m pleased that, from what we know about the bill so far, many New Jerseyans will receive direct relief from the economic impacts of #COVID19.
1844	2020-03-25 18:14:31+00:00	BREAKING: I just signed an Executive Order requiring child care centers to close by April 1st UNLESS they are solely serving children of essential workers. While essential workers commit themselves to our New Jersey family, we will commit ourselves to protecting their families.
1845	2020-03-25 18:14:22+00:00	It is my fervent hope that these preparedness measures remain just that – measures of preparedness. But we will be prepared. We will not be left scrambling. We will be ready to act decisively to protect the health of our residents.
1846	2020-03-25 18:13:22+00:00	Thank you to @ShopRiteStores and @WakefernFood for your help in securing trailers for the mobile field hospital equipment.
1847	2020-03-25 18:13:10+00:00	I cannot express enough my gratitude to the @USACEHQ for their quick work and ability to hit the ground at full speed alongside us, and to @NJSP Captain Sean Kilcomons and the Troopers for their efforts.
1848	2020-03-25 18:12:56+00:00	I’m extremely grateful to @realDonaldTrump and to @fema for making the field medical stations available to us, and for making @USACEHQ Lt. Colonel David Park and Pete Tranchik available to us.
1849	2020-03-25 18:12:14+00:00	These steps will allow us to expand hospital capacity rapidly in the short-term, and ensure both a proper continuum of care for those residents who will need it, and greater flexibility for our health care system to respond to this emergency.
1850	2020-03-25 18:12:04+00:00	To follow will be 500 beds at the New Jersey Convention Center in Edison, and 250 beds at the Atlantic City Convention Center. These are the plans as current, and we will make changes if the facts on the ground warrant us to do so.
1851	2020-03-25 18:11:45+00:00	The first site, which we will begin work on immediately in hopes of having it fully functional and ready to call into service, will be 250 beds at the Meadowlands Convention Center in Secaucus.
1852	2020-03-25 18:11:16+00:00	We’ve also identified three locations where temporary hospitals can be stood-up, one in each region of our state – north, central, and south – a total additional 1,000 beds that can be activated in just a matter of days and weeks.
1853	2020-03-25 18:11:05+00:00	With these steps, we can bring 1,360 new beds online.
1854	2020-03-25 18:10:57+00:00	We’ve been working with @USACEHQ to ready wings in hospitals across NJ, working directly with our hospital systems to build-out capacity within their current facilities. Additionally, @NJDeptofHealth is working on bringing closed hospitals back in service.
1855	2020-03-25 18:10:15+00:00	We will need to increase our hospital capacity. This is a given. NJ currently has 18,433 acute care beds, including 2,000 beds for those requiring critical care. Over the next several weeks, our goal is to increase our capacity by 2,360.
1856	2020-03-25 18:08:23+00:00	We have been working aggressively to rapidly expand hospital capacity. Make no mistake, we are in the fight to save lives.
1857	2020-03-25 18:08:08+00:00	At this moment, our hospital networks, while they are under tremendous stress, are currently meeting the needs of the patients who require hospitalization. But, we must be ready for the time when the surge comes and this is no longer the case.
1858	2020-03-25 18:07:33+00:00	Essex County will open a drive-through testing facility for county residents TOMORROW. For more information, or to make an appointment, please visit http://essexcovid.org
1859	2020-03-25 18:06:11+00:00	These numbers are sobering, but they are not surprising. We knew early on the trajectory these reports would take – especially as we ramped up our testing regime – and they are doing just that.
1860	2020-03-25 18:05:38+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 736 new positive #COVID19 test results since yesterday, bringing our total to 4,402. Sadly, we’ve learned of 18 additional deaths. To date, that means 62 of our fellow New Jerseyans have passed due to #COVID19 related complications.

1864	2020-03-25 13:48:11+00:00	Great work New Jersey! We are in the top five nationwide for social distancing! This IS WORKING. Keep doing your part and we will #FlattenTheCurve.
1865	2020-03-25 13:24:41+00:00	To non-essential non-retail businesses refusing to follow our work-from-home order: This is not a polite suggestion. It is an order. This is about public health and people’s lives. If you believe an employer is violating Executive Order 107: https://covid19.nj.gov/violation
1866	2020-03-25 00:21:10+00:00	I continue to urge New Jerseyans to STAY HOME and only go out when absolutely necessary.
1867	2020-03-25 00:21:10+00:00	BREAKING: Effective immediately, the following retail businesses are considered essential and permitted to operate: Mobile phone retail, repair shops Bicycle shops, only for service and repair Livestock feed stores Nurseries, garden centers Farming equipment stores
1868	2020-03-24 23:29:19+00:00	UPDATE: We were granted a federal waiver to cancel statewide assessments for this spring. With students unable to attend school, it's not feasible to move forward with testing. This will not prevent students from meeting their graduation requirements. https://www.nj.gov/education/broadcasts/2020/mar/24/New%20Jersey%20Cancels%20Statewide%20Student%20Assessments.pdf
1869	2020-03-24 21:15:28+00:00	One of the greatest lessons we are relearning now is the value to our society of the journalists whose mission it is to tell us about our world. I am saddened to learn of Alan Finder’s passing. His spirit lives on in the heroic work of the reporters whose stories we read today.
1870	2020-03-24 20:56:48+00:00	모든 뉴져지 주민분들은 외출을 삼가합니다. 공공장소 활동은 금지합니다. 모든 불필요한 비즈니스 활동은 따로 공문이 있을 때까지 제한합니다. 더 많은 정보는: http://covid19.nj.gov https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200323e.shtml
1871	2020-03-24 20:24:22+00:00	As of 1:30 PM, #COVID19 statewide stats: • Positive Tests: 3,675 • Deaths: 44 For updates: http://covid19.nj.gov

1874	2020-03-24 18:42:53+00:00	This is, truly and in every sense of the word, an unprecedented time for our state. But we are going to get through this, and we’re going to get through it together. #JerseyStrong
1875	2020-03-24 18:42:20+00:00	No one who can do their job from home should be going to work in an office. We must have 100% compliance. This is about people’s lives, your employees' lives, their families’ lives, and your life. Inquiries about failures to comply should be directed to 609-963-6817.
1876	2020-03-24 18:41:50+00:00	We’re hearing too many reports of some non-retail businesses which are violating the order requiring 100% work-from-home with some limited exception. Let me be clear: my Executive Order is not a polite suggestion. It is an order.
1877	2020-03-24 18:41:36+00:00	It takes up to two weeks for people to show signs of illness. New cases today could still mean new cases two weeks from now – and so on and so on. Unless we all act today to slow its spread. EVERYONE NEEDS to practice social distancing.
1878	2020-03-24 18:41:17+00:00	PLEASE keep doing the smart things to protect yourself and others: Stay at home Wash your hands If you do go out – practice both safe respiratory hygiene and social distancing
1879	2020-03-24 18:37:47+00:00	DO NOT BE ALARMED BY OUR NUMBERS. The more we have facts, the more we can make fully informed decisions, as opposed to educated guesses. Yes, they are big and getting bigger, and will continue to do so over the coming days. But they’re critical to winning the #COVID19 battle.
1880	2020-03-24 18:37:13+00:00	It will take time for us to see the impacts of social distancing. While we cannot wait to see these numbers plateau and, eventually, decrease, we do not know when that will be. We will continue to take every step possible to ensure social distancing.
1881	2020-03-24 18:36:24+00:00	Our @fema-partnered testing sites remain open daily, and more county sites are being set up. @passaic_county will be opening a testing site tomorrow at @wpunj_edu. This site is open ONLY to Passaic County residents and you must have a doctor’s referral for testing.
1882	2020-03-24 18:34:21+00:00	We have now lost 44 fellow New Jerseyans to #COVID19. If anyone is looking to me for a reason to justify the steps I’ve ordered, I can now give you 44.
1883	2020-03-24 18:33:55+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 846 new positive #COVID19 test results since yesterday, bringing our total to 3,675. We’ve also learned of an additional 17 deaths, and we join these families in mourning their loss.
1884	2020-03-24 18:23:01+00:00	REMINDER: We’ve launched a jobs portal to help residents who have lost their jobs as a result of #COVID19 find and apply for a new job at one of our essential workplaces. Looking for work? Visit: https://jobs.covid19.nj.gov Looking to hire? Visit: https://jobs.covid19.nj.gov/intake
1885	2020-03-24 18:22:25+00:00	Let me be clear: if these utilities do not voluntarily suspend shut-offs, I will order them to. No New Jerseyan should fear for losing their access to water throughout this emergency. Water utilities have until tomorrow to confirm w/ @NewJerseyDEP that they’re taking this step.
1886	2020-03-24 18:22:25+00:00	.@NewJerseyDEP, @NJDCA, &amp; @NJBPU have sent a letter to all municipal water utilities calling on them to voluntarily suspend all water shutoffs during #COVID19. Our private utility providers have already voluntarily suspended shut-offs. We need ALL water providers to follow suit.
1887	2020-03-24 18:19:30+00:00	Today, @PSEGdelivers announced they will be donating 50,000 N95 masks. I’m grateful to the many private-sector partners who have emerged over the past several days with generous PPE equipment donations and are pitching in to help our New Jersey family.
1888	2020-03-24 18:19:30+00:00	We still need more equipment for our hospitals and responders. Anyone with supplies to donate at this time should email @NJSP at ppedonations@njsp.org
1889	2020-03-24 18:19:29+00:00	Following my productive conservation with @realDonaldTrump from yesterday, we will soon receive a second shipment of sorely needed PPE from the national stockpile for our front-line medical personnel: 200,000-plus N95 masks More than 84,000 respirators Other gear
1890	2020-03-24 18:17:07+00:00	I remain hopeful that a direct cash infusion from Washington to states will happen soon. I fully intend to keep burning up the phone lines to Washington to see this through.
1891	2020-03-24 18:17:07+00:00	Last night, @NJTreasury announced that more than $900 million in discretionary budget spending for the current fiscal year has been placed into reserve. Given the impact this emergency is having on our economy, this is the right decision to protect our state’s fiscal stability.
1892	2020-03-24 18:14:53+00:00	With students at home, and not in their regular classrooms, it is simply not feasible for us to be able to move forward with testing in any meaningful way. This decision will not impact the graduation requirements of any student.
1893	2020-03-24 18:14:52+00:00	We fully expect this waiver to be granted, and Counsel’s Office is already at work on a subsequent executive order to address the impacts of this decision on other areas of state law, and that will be forthcoming.
1894	2020-03-24 18:14:52+00:00	After careful discussion with @NewJerseyDOE and @NewJerseyOAG, we’ve applied for the available federal waiver to cancel all student standardized testing scheduled for April.
1895	2020-03-24 18:11:25+00:00	Giving New Jerseyans an update on COVID-19. WATCH:
1896	2020-03-24 15:39:49+00:00	I said it before but it needs to be said again: life is not coming to a complete standstill in New Jersey. Grocery stores will continue to get food and toilet paper. Stop overbuying. Start being more considerate of fellow New Jerseyans.
1897	2020-03-24 00:45:11+00:00	My top priority is the health and safety of ALL New Jerseyans – including those who are incarcerated. I commend @NewJerseyOAG, county prosecutors, @NJPUBDEF and @ACLUNJ for balancing public health, public safety, and victims’ rights.
1898	2020-03-23 22:38:29+00:00	To those who are fueling price gouging or engaging in racist or bullying behavior – there is a special place in hell for the people who take advantage of this health crisis. We will pursue and prosecute hate crimes and consumer fraud to the fullest extent of the law.
1899	2020-03-23 22:12:33+00:00	Great talking to you, Andy. We must follow the lead of public health experts to #FlattenTheCurve in New Jersey and around the world.
1900	2020-03-23 22:03:23+00:00	.@VP praised our aggressive and proactive measures, and reassured us that the federal government will be with us every step of the way as we navigate #COVID19. This unprecedented crisis requires unprecedented action across all levels of government. Together we will save lives.
1901	2020-03-23 22:03:23+00:00	I informed @VP that we will be submitting a federal major disaster declaration request, and let him know that we have already submitted a Title 32 request. I also echoed @GovLarryHogan’s call for direct cash assistance to states in the federal response bill.
1902	2020-03-23 22:03:22+00:00	Participated in a video call today on #COVID19 mitigation with @VP, Dr. Debbie Birx, @WhiteHouse officials, and fellow governors, where I thanked the Vice President for today’s PPE shipment and for @realDonaldTrump's approval of four new @FEMA field hospitals in New Jersey.
1903	2020-03-23 21:33:20+00:00	Grateful for the leadership of our faith leaders practicing social distancing while spreading the faith, helping us stay connected, and lifting our state’s spirits during these uncertain times.

1908	2020-03-23 16:46:56+00:00	We have a critical need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). If you have any of these supplies and would like to donate, please email ppedonations@njsp.org

1910	2020-03-23 16:30:12+00:00	Let’s all do our part. When we do, there is nothing that can defeat us. Period, full stop.
1911	2020-03-23 16:30:12+00:00	I know the numbers you hear every day are worrying, because they aren’t going down. But, let’s remember that each number is a fellow New Jerseyan who needs us to rally together behind them, and behind each other to #FlattenTheCurve and slow the spread of disease.

1916	2020-03-23 16:23:32+00:00	With the dramatic shortfall in personal protective equipment we face, it’s imperative that we work to strategically preserve supplies and equipment for emergency purposes only. #FlattenTheCurve
1917	2020-03-23 16:23:32+00:00	I just signed an Executive Order suspending ALL elective surgeries and invasive procedures for adults – both medical and dental – effective 5:00 PM on 3/27. This applies to all operations that can be safely delayed, as determined by the patient’s doctor or dentist.

1988	2020-03-20 18:28:44+00:00	Expanding testing is a game-changer in our overall efforts. Since lab capacity is no longer an issue in NJ, we can move forward to increasing specimen-collection statewide.
1989	2020-03-20 18:28:44+00:00	BREAKING: We are greatly INCREASING our daily statewide testing capacity, in partnership with @BioReference and @LabCorp. Expanded testing is absolutely critical to saving lives, flattening the curve, and mitigating further spread of #COVID19.
1990	2020-03-20 18:25:24+00:00	To be clear: the number of positive tests is rising, in part, because of expanding capabilities from private labs. We expected these numbers, and we expect them to keep rising, in the short-term, as greater testing capabilities come online.

1996	2020-03-20 01:07:09+00:00	BREAKING: I just signed legislation to expand access to telehealth services and expedite licensure of out-of-state professionals.

Today, I met with @USACEHQ Major General Jeffrey Milhorn on expanding our capabilities ASAP. I am optimistic that, working together, we will save thousands of lives.
2002	2020-03-19 21:01:06+00:00	BREAKING: I just enacted a moratorium on removing people from their homes due to evictions or foreclosures. No renter or homeowner can be evicted until further notice. Keeping people in their homes protects all of us against increased risk of contracting and spreading #COVID19.

2008	2020-03-19 16:56:08+00:00	I ask everyone to stay safe. Keep washing those hands. And keep practicing social distancing. We will flatten this curve, and we will emerge from this stronger than ever.
2009	2020-03-19 16:56:02+00:00	To all New Jerseyans – I deeply appreciate your cooperation with our efforts to promote social distancing. I know it’s not easy being cooped-up in the house, but this what we all need to get through this together.

2012	2020-03-19 16:55:49+00:00	.@SBAgov has approved our application for small businesses to apply for federal disaster loans. This is good news, but I would urge all but the hardest-hit businesses to take a step back, if possible.
2013	2020-03-19 16:53:23+00:00	We cannot have families anxious about their health anxious about whether they’re going to lose a roof over their heads. I urge banks and lenders to do what they can for this mortgage customers to make loan repayment much more flexible in the coming weeks and months.
2014	2020-03-19 16:51:26+00:00	I am ordering, effective 8:00 PM tonight, the closure of all personal-care businesses and social clubs which cannot comply with social distancing guidelines until further notice, including: • Barber shops • Hair salons • Spas • Nail and eyelash salons • Tattoo parlors
2015	2020-03-19 16:43:15+00:00	At this time, there are NO CHANGES being announced for our scheduled June 2nd primary elections. We will not hesitate to act if the emergency requires us to do so. We want to make sure everyone is safe in voting.

2020	2020-03-19 16:38:26+00:00	The COVID-19 crisis is putting a tremendous strain on our health care resources, and we’re all working together make sure that our front-line health responders have what they need to not only save lives, but to keep safe themselves.

Moments like this remind all of us that we have the #1 public schools in the nation because we have the best educators.
2026	2020-03-18 22:32:48+00:00	Looking for something to do tonight while staying in? Give a listen to my conversation with @oldmanebro, @Rosenbergradio, and @LAURASTYLEZ about the steps we’re taking in NJ to slow the spread of #COVID19. 
2027	2020-03-18 22:16:52+00:00	Just held a call with hospital administrators and health care union leaders, who are on the front lines of our fight against #COVID19. We’re doing everything we can to ensure they have the supplies they need to do their jobs and protect their own health.

2031	2020-03-18 20:32:40+00:00	Grateful for our incredible educators, food service staff, and maintenance staff who are working around the clock to ensure our students have access to healthy meals.
2032	2020-03-18 19:10:00+00:00	UPDATE: @PennsylvaniaGov has joined our regional coalition to combat #COVID19. NJ, PA, NY, and CT are now working together to encourage social distancing and strengthen our greater regional preparedness.

2033	2020-03-18 18:50:23+00:00	NEW: To help provide safe and reliable child care for parents on the front lines of our #COVID19 response, @NJDHS Commissioner Johnson and I have added new amendments and resources to New Jersey’s Child Care Subsidy Program.

2034	2020-03-18 18:26:44+00:00	This is an anxious time, but now is the time for us to come together. There is no greater call than to do something bigger than one’s self. This is a time for us to think of others and act to protect our entire family.
2035	2020-03-18 18:24:39+00:00	More than ever, we need our faith communities to keep spreading the faith. We need them to stay active in our communities and help us disseminate vital information. We need them to rally our communities to send up their prayers to lift our state’s spirits.
2036	2020-03-18 18:24:39+00:00	We know that many of our houses of worship are facing very real challenges because of our social distancing actions, and we pledge to work with them to seek out creative ways to mitigate their pain and ensure their long-term health.
2037	2020-03-18 18:23:26+00:00	We’ve been communicating daily with our faith communities to help us get our messages out. I thank our faith community for fully embracing the need for social distancing, especially when social distancing is the opposite of what many of our faiths teach.
2038	2020-03-18 18:21:52+00:00	We need everyone who is part of our front-line army to be able to get to work so we can beat back the threat of #COVID19 together. In this, child care professionals are, themselves, essential players.
2039	2020-03-18 18:21:34+00:00	Commissioner Johnson and @NJDHS are doing all they can to ensure that the families of those working on our front lines are able to continue to access the critical child care services they need.
2040	2020-03-18 18:20:43+00:00	To be clear, we consider home health aides and other direct support professionals to be an essential part of our emergency response team. They are first responders within our health care system for many in communities across our state, and we thank them.
2041	2020-03-18 18:18:51+00:00	I take personal responsibility for the public health and safety of New Jersey. If you are unhappy about our aggressive social distancing measures, I’m sorry. But your safety is my highest priority.
2042	2020-03-18 18:12:14+00:00	In direct response to the letter I sent @POTUS yesterday, I had a conversation today w/ @USACEHQ Major General Jeffrey Millhorn. He will be coming here tomorrow for a meeting w/ me to to see how the Corps will help us build-out plans for expanding NJ’s hospital capacity.
2043	2020-03-18 18:10:43+00:00	Sadly, we have learned of two additional deaths related to cases of #COVID19. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families during this difficult time.
2044	2020-03-18 18:10:14+00:00	UPDATE: We’ve received 162 new positive test results since yesterday, bringing our statewide total to 427.

2051	2020-03-18 02:00:17+00:00	This public health crisis is a direct threat to our national security. The Northeast, the densest region in the nation, is the most susceptible to #COVID19. By working together to identify buildings to use as emergency care facilities, we can save many thousands of lives.
2052	2020-03-18 02:00:16+00:00	Today, I wrote to @POTUS requesting the support of the U.S. military and the @USACEHQ to assist our efforts to expand hospital and intensive care unit capacity in preparation for the continued spread of #COVID19. https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200317c.shtml

For more information: https://www.nj.gov/labor/worker-protections/earnedsick/covid.shtml
2055	2020-03-17 22:49:28+00:00	Today I mandated the indefinite closure across New Jersey of all indoor portions of retail shopping malls, and all indoor and outdoor places of public amusement. This aggressive step will help us #FlattenTheCurve and combat #COVID19. https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200317a.shtml
2056	2020-03-17 21:19:07+00:00	We will get through this. We will get through this because we’re going to keep looking out for each other and after each other. We’re going to get through this because we will follow common sense and be guided by facts. We will get through this as one New Jersey family.
2057	2020-03-17 19:53:34+00:00	Thank you to all of the courageous firefighters, law enforcement officers, and EMS workers on the front lines of our fight against #COVID19. We owe them our deepest gratitude.

2060	2020-03-17 19:49:04+00:00	We have 89 new positive #COVID19 cases, bringing our total to 267. • Bergen: 84 • Burlington: 5 • Camden: 3 • Essex: 32 • Gloucester: 2 • Hudson: 24 • Hunterdon: 4 • Mercer: 9
2061	2020-03-17 18:30:51+00:00	If all nine million of us do our part, we will get through this. We will get through this as one New Jersey family, stronger than ever.
2062	2020-03-17 18:25:57+00:00	I know this is a time of heightened anxiety. But, we are New Jerseyans. We’ve proven, time and time again, that we are the most resilient people you can find anywhere.
2063	2020-03-17 18:25:16+00:00	To all residents – I urge you to be vigilant against scammers trying to profit from this emergency. If you receive a call from a scammer or suspect price gouging, please report it to @ConsumerNJ at (973) 504-6240 or at http://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov
2064	2020-03-17 18:24:43+00:00	We’re working nonstop to ensure that we are on a strong footing to protect our economy and people’s jobs, so we can emerge stronger once this emergency is over.
2065	2020-03-17 18:24:28+00:00	The emergency response bill currently moving through Congress would provide employees with significant sick-leave and paid family benefits. Not paying employees now might keep them from taking advantage of these.
2066	2020-03-17 18:24:03+00:00	I thank every business – large and small – doing the right and keeping their employees on payroll. We implore every business owner, to every degree possible, to follow their model and continue paying worker.
2067	2020-03-17 18:23:53+00:00	I also urge banks to do what they can for their mortgage customers to make loan repayment much more flexible in the coming weeks and months. This is particularly truly for works in the hardest hit sectors, who work by-the-hour, or those in the gig economy.
2068	2020-03-17 18:23:41+00:00	I encourage banks, particularly the local & regional lenders who are deeply embedded in their communities, to do the right thing and work directly with their small business clients to defer loan payments, or to open up credit lines for critical working capital whenever possible.
2069	2020-03-17 18:22:29+00:00	We’re working with our partners in the Legislature in the hopes of standing up a state business-assistance program within the coming week.
2070	2020-03-17 18:22:12+00:00	Our full application was submitted this morning, and we’re pushing for swift approval. We’re also working to ensure continuity of operations for ongoing construction projects.
2071	2020-03-17 18:21:39+00:00	We know that anxiety is high among New Jersey business owners - particularly, among our small businesses. Our entire economic team is working alongside @SBAgov to ensure that available financial relief can flow into New Jersey as quickly and efficiently as possible.
2072	2020-03-17 18:20:45+00:00	We have among the nation’s strongest paid sick leave and expanded paid family leave laws. I urge every resident whose job has been directly impacted to visit http://nj.gov/labor for comprehensive information from @NJLaborDept.
2073	2020-03-17 18:20:13+00:00	We’re asking the federal government for assistance in ensuring that every unemployment insurance application is properly received and handled.
2074	2020-03-17 18:19:44+00:00	Help is available for residents who are out of work as a direct result of this emergency. Workers whose place of employment has closed, or whose hours have been cut, as a result of #COVID19 are, in all likelihood, eligible to receive either full or partial unemployment insurance.
2075	2020-03-17 18:19:04+00:00	Outside of our restrictions on malls, restaurants and bars, and other businesses specifically ordered to shut down – all other non-essential retail, recreational, and entertainment businesses may remain open until 8:00 PM daily if they abide by social distancing guidelines.
2076	2020-03-17 18:18:36+00:00	Restaurants which are located within malls, and which also have their own entrances separate from the general mall entrances, may remain open for takeout or delivery only.
2077	2020-03-17 18:18:21+00:00	Effective 8:00 PM tonight, I’m directing the closure of all indoor retail shopping malls, amusement parks, and amusement centers across New Jersey until the current emergency ends.
2078	2020-03-17 18:17:55+00:00	We understand that county and local governments are focused on their own concerns. We ask these officials to coordinate closely with us prior to making any local directive.
2079	2020-03-17 18:16:09+00:00	I have sent a letter to @POTUS requesting the assistance of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in constructing temporary hospitals to ensure our greater regional preparedness and help alleviate the strain on our hospitals.
2080	2020-03-17 18:15:00+00:00	Today is Day One of life in New Jersey under the aggressive social distancing measures we put in place yesterday to #FlattenTheCurve. I thank everyone who is taking these measures to heart, and urge others to follow their lead. If there is no reason to be out, don’t go out.
2081	2020-03-17 18:13:42+00:00	#COVID19 UPDATES: We’ve received 89 new positive test results since yesterday, bringing our statewide total to 267.

2110	2020-03-16 18:10:29+00:00	Governor Announces Extensive Social Distancing Measures to Mitigate Further Spread of COVID-19
2111	2020-03-16 16:54:27+00:00	Just finished our weekly video call on #COVID19 mitigation with @POTUS, @VP, Ambassador Debbie Birx, @WhiteHouse officials, and fellow governors. Now is the time to come together as a nation. Social distancing works – and we need to slow the spread to save lives.
2112	2020-03-16 15:46:58+00:00	We do not take any of the steps we’ve announced today lightly. We know that these will impact residents and families, communities, and businesses. But our paramount concern is to #FlattenTheCurve – these steps will ensure we do not overload our health care system.

2118	2020-03-16 15:46:57+00:00	We’ve worked closely to ensure that the overall educational and individual needs of students can be met during this closure, including appropriate home instruction and continued access to free and reduced meals.

We MUST increase access to #COVID19 screening, testing and treatment for all New Jerseyans.
2126	2020-03-15 18:30:39+00:00	It will take our entire New Jersey family pulling together for us to emerge from this emergency stronger than before. We will have further announcements as warranted. We are committed to being proactive, and to getting through this together.
2127	2020-03-15 18:29:33+00:00	Grateful to everyone who is working on the front lines of our response – from public health workers, to janitors and custodians, to the people stocking grocery store shelves.
2128	2020-03-15 18:28:41+00:00	We strongly urge EVERYONE to practice social distancing. Even if you are young and feel entirely healthy, you can still spread #COVID19.
2129	2020-03-15 18:26:10+00:00	We’ve established an online portal for all businesses, small and large, to get answers to their questions and concerns as the #COVID19 emergency impacts our economy. For more information, visit: http://cv.business.nj.gov.

2132	2020-03-15 18:23:26+00:00	Today, I am requesting that the federal government open an emergency enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act to give people – whether they are uninsured or underinsured – the opportunity to get quality health coverage.

2138	2020-03-14 18:12:00+00:00	The guidance and recommendations of our administration regarding “social distancing” still stands. We continue to urge, as strongly as we can, the cancellation of public gatherings in excess of 250 people.
2139	2020-03-14 18:10:01+00:00	.@DrLRepollet and @NewJerseyDOE continue to work with our school districts toward the inevitable extended shutdown of our schools.
2140	2020-03-14 18:09:26+00:00	Last night, we received word that nationwide regulatory relief has been given to the trucking industry to allow supplies to flow – from medical supplies to our public health workers, to groceries and supplies to markets. 
2141	2020-03-14 18:09:01+00:00	We continue to work with our federal partners, from @CDCgov and individual Departments, to get the guidance and support we need to ensure the health and safety of our residents.
2142	2020-03-14 18:07:45+00:00	We’re pleased by the House's passage last night of the federal response bill, and also by @realDonaldTrump’s support for it. We urge the Senate to pass it immediately so we can keep moving forward without delay.
2143	2020-03-14 18:07:21+00:00	We continue to work alongside local and county health officials, our hospitals, and our public health workforce to closely monitor the situation across New Jersey so we can take aggressive action to mitigate the spread of illness.

2146	2020-03-14 15:16:54+00:00	Saddened by the death of New Brunswick's own J. Seward Johnson – pioneering artist, sculptor, and founder of @gfsnj. His incredible work will live on and continue to inspire generations.

2149	2020-03-13 18:43:48+00:00	We need to take this public health emergency on as one New Jersey family. If we all stay focused – if we all do our parts – we can better protect our families and our state, and be a leader in winning the fight against the coronavirus.
2150	2020-03-13 18:43:13+00:00	I also thank the janitorial and custodial staffs everywhere – from schools and hospitals to office buildings – who are doing all they can keep the places where people go clean. We cannot thank these people enough.
2151	2020-03-13 18:43:05+00:00	We must recognize the tremendous efforts of every public health worker who is putting the rest of his or her life on hold to help us respond to this emergency.
2152	2020-03-13 18:42:43+00:00	Please make a phone call to older neighbors or family members during this time. This is a time of heightened anxiety for them – check in and make sure they have everything they need to be safe.
2153	2020-03-13 18:42:18+00:00	We continue to urge everyone to continue doing all they can to help mitigate this emergency – wash your hands, practice safe respiratory hygiene, and keep a safe 6-foot distance from others, especially those who may be ill.
2154	2020-03-13 18:42:13+00:00	The steps we are taking to stabilize our state’s financial health – a stronger surplus, and hundreds of millions of dollars in our rainy-day fund – are more essential than ever.
2155	2020-03-13 18:41:53+00:00	New Jersey has some of the nation’s strongest laws as they pertain to mandatory paid sick leave and expanded paid family leave. These were smart policies before this emergency – and they are absolutely necessary today.
2156	2020-03-13 18:41:41+00:00	We will continue to engage with the federal government and will continue to push, as needed, to make sure we have the ability to meet the needs of New Jersey.
2157	2020-03-13 18:41:33+00:00	We received word last night from @HHSGov that, in the coming days, a shipment of medical supplies will be arriving in NJ for our front-line public-health responders – including more than 84,000 N95 respirators, 200,000 surgical masks, 38,000 face shields, and other needed items.
2158	2020-03-13 18:41:28+00:00	We’re also currently working to receive federal waivers to ensure that school children in districts impacted by closures retain access to a healthy lunch.
2159	2020-03-13 18:41:23+00:00	.@NJDHS has been in contact with the federal government to seek a waiver that would allow SNAP recipients an additional one-half-month’s worth of benefits, so families can stock-up on food and other supplies.
2160	2020-03-13 18:41:18+00:00	Our administration has applied to @USDOT for the necessary waiver to allow our trucking industry the flexibility it needs to keep supplies rolling to market.
2161	2020-03-13 18:41:08+00:00	.@NJBPU has confirmed that, in cooperation with our utility companies, all utility shut-off orders have been VOLUNTARILY AND UNIVERSALLY SUSPENDED for the time-being.
2162	2020-03-13 18:39:44+00:00	Additionally, today, I wrote the federal government requesting a nationwide extension of the REAL ID deadline.
2163	2020-03-13 18:39:26+00:00	This means if you have a March 31 expiration date, you now have until May 31. If you have an April 30 expiration date, you have until June 30. If you have a May 31 expiration date, you have until July 31.
2164	2020-03-13 18:39:22+00:00	At @NJ_MVC, all residents who have their driver’s license, auto registration, or vehicle inspection due for renewal by May 31 will receive an AUTOMATIC TWO-MONTH EXTENSION.
2165	2020-03-13 18:39:12+00:00	We must ensure that we have plans for a child’s well-being, food security, and remote-learning as we close down our schools.
2166	2020-03-13 18:38:33+00:00	We must take into account the significant educational and socioeconomic impacts which occur when schools are closed for extended periods. We need to ensure solutions to mitigate these impacts a statewide closure would have before such a declaration.
2167	2020-03-13 18:38:21+00:00	We will be guided not just by public health needs but also ensuring the individual needs of those districts are being met.
2168	2020-03-13 18:38:08+00:00	We're working toward the inevitability that every district will be closed for a prolonged period of time. Each district and community has their own set of challenges and reality.
2169	2020-03-13 18:37:15+00:00	For many districts, that time is now. For others, we're working to ensure that when their time comes, they will be prepared to provide all critical services for their community.
2170	2020-03-13 18:37:11+00:00	With regard to our public schools, we have been and are now actively working with our public school districts on extended closure plans to prepare for a potential statewide closure.
2171	2020-03-13 18:35:36+00:00	Yesterday, I recommended the cancellation of all public gatherings, statewide, of 250+ people. I reiterate this recommendation, and if necessary will mandate it. Social distancing represents our best chance to #FlattenTheCurve.

2173	2020-03-13 18:34:49+00:00	New Jersey has been ahead of the curve in our #COVID19 preparations. We will continue to be so if we follow our north star: To be smart and measured To take steps that are appropriate To be guided by facts and science
2174	2020-03-13 18:34:02+00:00	We’re taking every appropriate step to reduce the spread of coronavirus, limit the harm, and care for the sick. We’re following the facts on the ground so we can ensure our response is fully directed by medical expertise and sound science.

His story should compel all of us to fight for justice until our world more closely aligns with our highest ideals.
2189	2020-03-11 13:54:21+00:00	It bears repeating: #COVID19 is NO excuse for racism. This is a time for us to come together as one New Jersey family, not discriminate against our Asian American communities and businesses.

We’re prepared and we’re staying vigilant. https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200302b.shtml
2226	2020-03-02 20:50:35+00:00	Governor, it’s important for us all to acknowledge the truth about the recent past so, working together, our state can move forward. New Jersey is finally on the right path. And no amount of revisionist history from you will change that.
2227	2020-03-02 20:50:35+00:00	Despite lavish and wasteful incentives, NJ lagged the region and country in every key economic measure under your watch. Now, new businesses are thriving – high propensity business applications in NJ today are double the rate of the Northeast, with record low unemployment.
2228	2020-03-02 20:50:35+00:00	Though your administration didn’t invent the pension crisis, you did little to fix it. With our FY21 budget, we’ll have paid more in three budgets than you did in eight. And we won't stop until, finally, our state once again makes its full pension payment.
2229	2020-03-02 20:50:35+00:00	Your administration gutted the state subsidy to NJ TRANSIT by as much as 90%, leaving the agency reeling. With our FY21 budget, we’re doubling down on our investment in NJ TRANSIT with a state-record $591m state subsidy. We’re slowly reversing the incredible damage you did.
2230	2020-03-02 20:50:34+00:00	Your administration underfunded K-12 classrooms by $9 billion over your eight years in office. With our FY21 budget, we’re now putting almost $1 billion more into education every year than the budget we inherited.
2231	2020-03-02 20:50:34+00:00	Governor: you may still be fooling yourself, but you've long ago stopped fooling New Jersey. We're working hard to restore funding to education, NJT, and the pension system that you stripped to protect the wealthy and well connected. New Jersey, at long last, is moving forward.
2232	2020-03-02 19:03:34+00:00	Just participated in a video conference call on #COVID19 preparedness with @VP, Ambassador Debbie Birx, @SecAzar, and fellow governors.

2236	2020-03-01 18:43:54+00:00	We’re still digging out of the spectacular failure brought by your eight budgets. Budgets that prioritized the wealthy and well-connected over our middle class, led to 11 credit downgrades, devastated @NJTRANSIT commuters, and failed to invest in public education.

2259	2020-02-26 18:58:00+00:00	With the Garden State Guarantee, more New Jerseyans will be able to attend a four-year public college or university tuition-free for two years. We’re siding with students and putting an affordable college degree within reach for more New Jerseyans. https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200226a.shtml
2260	2020-02-26 18:28:37+00:00	This morning I convened members of my team to discuss our coronavirus preparations, from airport screenings to hospital preparedness. We are collaborating with our federal partners, state authorities, and local heath officials to protect all New Jerseyans.

2267	2020-02-25 19:56:46+00:00	Billions given away in open-ended corporate tax breaks will be billions we will not have to make our state more affordable for residents and businesses. We need a tax incentives program whose focus is on expanding our economy, not rewarding special interests. #NJProgress
2268	2020-02-25 19:51:45+00:00	We’re continuing our work fixing @NJTRANSIT by increasing our investment by another $132 million – to a record total of nearly $600 million. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ
2269	2020-02-25 19:51:14+00:00	Let’s raise the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966. It’s still just $2. These fees are meant to cover the costs of background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands, and they don’t come close. This is about public safety. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ
2270	2020-02-25 19:50:04+00:00	Our Garden State Guarantee will build upon the successful model of our Community College Opportunity Grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four-year public colleges and universities tuition-free to thousands of eligible students. #NJProgress

2272	2020-02-25 19:42:22+00:00	Throughout 2019, high-propensity business applications in New Jersey grew every quarter. Businesses sees the advantages of New Jersey – that’s why our budget will continue to invest in making our state more competitive for businesses. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ

2275	2020-02-25 19:37:32+00:00	Lowering health care costs is property tax relief. In FY2021, we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid benefits by another $174 million – the first time in memory that we have year-over-year-over-year reductions in the overall cost of health care. #NJProgress
2276	2020-02-25 19:32:25+00:00	School funding is property tax relief. Every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief.

2277	2020-02-25 19:30:05+00:00	In our first two years working together, we have achieved the first & fourth-lowest year-over-year increases in property taxes on record. No other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief. #NJProgress
2278	2020-02-25 19:27:58+00:00	A millionaire’s tax doesn’t punish the rich. It lifts up the middle class – that’s good for everyone. When we have tax fairness, we can continue our historic investments in our pension system and in our middle class families. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ
2279	2020-02-25 19:25:46+00:00	A millionaire’s tax will ensure fairness to the dedicated women and men of our public workforce and ensure tax fairness for our middle-class homeowners and renters, our seniors, and countless working families working to join the middle class. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ
2280	2020-02-25 19:25:11+00:00	With a $1.1 billion increase in our overall pension payment, we will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding administration did in eight. We can get this done with a millionaire’s tax. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ

2284	2020-02-25 19:20:52+00:00	Under this budget, we will continue growing our surplus to a projected $1.6 billion – triple the surplus of my predecessor’s final budget proposal. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ
2285	2020-02-25 19:14:01+00:00	The choices we make in our Fiscal Year 2021 budget come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table. #NJProgress #StrongerFairerNJ

2290	2020-02-24 21:18:41+00:00	Since taking office, we’ve worked to build a stronger and fairer economy for every New Jersey family, not just the wealthy or well-connected.

2293	2020-02-23 00:25:25+00:00	Health care is a right, not a privilege for a select few, and skyrocketing medical costs are a national emergency. If there’s anything my diagnosis reminds me of, it’s that preventative services are lifesaving and we need to continue fighting for affordable health care for all.
2294	2020-02-23 00:25:25+00:00	Over 50,000 New Jerseyans will hear the words “you have cancer” this year, so I’m far from alone here. It’s a situation that far too many families find themselves in. That’s why we’re fighting for them each and every day.
2295	2020-02-23 00:25:24+00:00	Friends – I’ve got a tumor on my left kidney and will undergo a partial nephrectomy in early March to remove it. The prognosis is very good and I’m profoundly grateful to my doctors for detecting the tumor early.
2296	2020-02-22 19:51:42+00:00	Last year, I signed into law a sweeping expansion of paid family leave: •Increasing leave time •Increasing benefits •Expanding eligibility No one should be forced to choose between caring for a loved one & earning a paycheck. https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562019/approved/20190219a.shtml /

2298	2020-02-21 01:32:55+00:00	From reforming our expungement system to restoring voting rights, we’re leading the nation in criminal justice reform. Proud to see New Jersey given a #1 ranking by @CCRC_Official for the bold steps we took last year.

2302	2020-02-20 21:38:41+00:00	Last night’s terrorist attack in Germany is another heartbreaking reminder of the bigotry that still plagues our world. Hanau – a city I know well – is a strong and resilient community that values inclusion and welcomes all. We will not let hate win.

2305	2020-02-20 17:07:59+00:00	I’m appalled by this act of anti-Semitism. Just this week, my Administration was in Lakewood working with the Orthodox Jewish Chamber to address security. We will hold those behind this responsible and rise above this hate.
2306	2020-02-20 15:22:57+00:00	First African American woman to serve in statewide elected office in New Jersey. First African American woman to serve as Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly. @LtGovOliver is a trailblazer in every sense. I’m privileged to serve this great state alongside her. #BlackHistoryMonth

2308	2020-02-20 00:10:17+00:00	The desire to improve our government is not a partisan endeavor. I’m grateful for the bipartisan support of Governor Codey, Senator Brown, and Assemblyman Peters in our effort to ensure that elected officials are serving the public interest, not the special interests.
2309	2020-02-20 00:10:16+00:00	It’s time to clean up Trenton.

2315	2020-02-18 19:06:05+00:00	Storyteller. Legend. Leader. Trailblazer. Today would have been Toni Morrison’s 89th birthday. Take time to read her work – which gives voice to the African American experience, yesterday and today. #BlackHistoryMonth
2316	2020-02-18 18:53:06+00:00	Workplace harassment & discrimination have no place in NJ. Today, I introduced legislation: •Establishing a clear definition of a hostile work environment •Mandating training on discrimination & harassment •Extending the NJLAD statute of limitations https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200218a.shtml
2317	2020-02-18 17:09:10+00:00	For too long, too many people have been degraded in their place of work. Join me live in Trenton as we introduce legislation to combat harassment and discrimination in the workplace and create a climate where all people are treated with dignity and respect.

2324	2020-02-15 20:04:14+00:00	Thrilled that @NAACP will hold their 113th National Convention in Atlantic City for the first time in over 50 years. Atlantic City has a rich legacy in the fight for civil rights and this is a true testament to our commitment to making New Jersey a place of fairness and justice.
2325	2020-02-15 01:00:17+00:00	Our communities are safer when we treat our residents with respect, and when law enforcement builds bridges through trust. This latest announcement runs counter to our Jersey values.
