478	2020-04-02 01:31:18+00:00	Beginning April 1 for a period of 60 days, no insurer in Connecticut – including health, property & casualty – may terminate an insurance policy because a policyholder does not pay a premium or interest during this time. Some good relief for many during this crisis. @chrislhayes
479	2020-04-02 01:15:47+00:00	I will continue to fight for and support the middle class, small businesses, and seniors of Connecticut.

486	2020-04-01 19:15:49+00:00	This is a virus that attacks our most fragile without mercy. This also stresses the importance of staying home and limiting exposure to other people. Your life and the lives of others could literally depend on it. Our prayers are with the family at this difficult time. (3/3)
487	2020-04-01 19:15:49+00:00	Testing confirmed last night that the newborn was COVID-19 positive. This is absolutely heartbreaking. We believe this is one of the youngest lives lost anywhere due to complications relating to COVID-19. (2/3)
488	2020-04-01 19:15:49+00:00	It is with heartbreaking sadness today that we can confirm the first pediatric fatality in Connecticut linked to #COVID19. A 6-week-old newborn from the Hartford area was brought unresponsive to a hospital late last week and could not be revived. (1/3)

494	2020-04-01 13:01:24+00:00	The workers at grocery stores deserve our praise because they are providing our communities with an invaluable service. All of us need to do what we can to keep supermarket employees healthy. Please follow some of these tips when food shopping.

496	2020-04-01 00:40:12+00:00	Bidding against other states and the feds for this life-saving gear is like surge pricing on Uber, only at the last minute the car drives away because you were outbid. There has to be a way to do it together — fed, state & locals — so we can get this equipment where it's needed.
497	2020-03-31 23:46:45+00:00	I'll be interviewed on @MSNBC with host @chrislhayes tonight at 8PM to discuss the latest on #COVID19 in Connecticut.
498	2020-03-31 23:14:41+00:00	It's crazy the way states are being forced to bid against each other for #PPE and other gear. It would be much more efficient if the federal gov't were able to do this and allocate it based on need. There must be a way the federal, state, and local gov't can speak with one voice.
499	2020-03-31 23:06:06+00:00	The executive order I'm signing today also requires school staff (teachers, cafeteria staff, clerical & custodial workers, bus drivers & others) continue to get paid during this crisis. We need them back when schools re-open. They're there for our kids, we need to support them!
500	2020-03-31 22:54:09+00:00	The executive order I'm signing today will give @CTDEEPNews the authority to limit visitors at @CTStateParks to the extent necessary in order to ensure people can adhere to safe social distancing.

785	2020-03-11 13:34:55+00:00	Having a unified approach between our state and municipalities is critical at times like this. We appreciate every town and city for their cooperation.
786	2020-03-11 11:38:33+00:00	Unfortunately, as with many events that have a large attendance, we are postponing #CareerConn to a date yet to be determined. Over 1,600 high school students from 40 school systems registered, in addition to adult learners, veterans, and 35 occupational schools. More info soon.
787	2020-03-11 01:16:59+00:00	ICYMI: Here is our 3:00 p.m. news briefing from today with updates on #Connecticut's #COVID19 preparedness and response efforts.
788	2020-03-10 22:01:19+00:00	To read the document I signed enacting the civil preparedness and public health emergencies, check out this link. And once again, stay healthy: Wash your hands, avoid shaking hands, and if you start to feel ill call your medical provider. (10/10) https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Office-of-the-Governor/News/20200310-declaration-of-civil-preparedness-and-public-health-emergency.pdf?la=en
789	2020-03-10 22:01:19+00:00	While the declarations remain active, our office can continue requiring specific emergency actions be taken. Over the coming days and weeks as the situation with #COVID19 develops, I'll keep you updated on any additional actions we take in accordance with the declarations. (9/10)
790	2020-03-10 22:01:19+00:00	While the declarations do permit us to take certain actions related to the closure of large gatherings, at this time those decisions are still being delegated to municipal officials as they are on the ground closest to the circumstances in each respective community. (8/10)
791	2020-03-10 22:01:18+00:00	Finally, the emergency declarations that I signed make it clear that the mayors and first selectmen of municipalities across our state have emergency powers under CGS Section 28-8a to take such actions as they deem necessary to mitigate disasters and emergencies. (7/10)
792	2020-03-10 22:01:18+00:00	Another immediate impact of the declarations is that they trigger the state law that prohibits profiteering during times of emergency (a.k.a. price gouging). Violations are considered an unfair or deceptive practice and violators may be subject to fines or other action. (6/10)
793	2020-03-10 22:01:18+00:00	One immediate impact of declaring them is that some consumers whose travel is impacted by #COVID19 may be able to benefit from travel insurance and related coverage depending on their policies. @CIDNEWS is notifying insurance companies and will be monitoring compliance. (5/10)
794	2020-03-10 22:01:18+00:00	Right now my office is compiling and evaluating specific recommendations from agencies and municipalities about statutes and regulations that should be suspended or modified. If it is determined that certain actions should be taken, we'll issue related orders as necessary. (4/10)
795	2020-03-10 22:01:17+00:00	Notably, the declarations provide my office with the authority to temporarily suspend or modify any state law or regulation during this emergency period if it is determined to be in the best interest of our residents and benefit their safety. (3/10)
796	2020-03-10 22:01:17+00:00	The declarations provide our administration with certain legal authorities so that we can take specific, swift actions that are determined to be necessary to protect the safety and health of residents during emergency situations, such as #COVID19. (2/10)
797	2020-03-10 22:01:17+00:00	Some folks have been wondering what the civil preparedness and public health emergencies on #COVID19 that I signed today means and how impacts the lives of people in #Connecticut, so this thread is a quick summary of what you need to know right now. (1/10)
798	2020-03-10 22:00:11+00:00	Today, we came together with leaders from both sides of the aisle to report the latest on #COVID19. As always we will continue updating as new information comes out.

813	2020-03-09 11:27:44+00:00	Although we've only had one confirmed case of a #Connecticut resident so far, the actions we take now, even if they feel early to some, we know from a public health perspective can make a meaningful difference in slowing the spread of #COVID19 and keep people healthy.
814	2020-03-09 11:27:44+00:00	This morning I sent the following email to all State of Connecticut executive branch agency employees announcing the implementation of some actions in our offices that will significantly and proactively escalate measures to prevent the spread of #coronavirus.
