122	2020-05-18 14:39:40+00:00	The Wall Street Journal Editorial states that it doesn’t want me to act in an “impulsive” manner in Afghanistan. Could somebody please explain to them that we have been there for 19 years, and while soldier counts are way down now, hardly impulsive. Besides, the Taliban is.....
123	2020-05-18 12:47:40+00:00	Wow! The Front Page @washingtonpost Headline reads, “A BOOST IN TESTS, BUT LACK OF TAKERS.” We have done a great job on Ventilators, Testing, and everything else. Were left little by Obama. Over 11 million tests, and going up fast. More than all countries in the world, combined.

How can a creep like this show up to work tomorrow &amp; report to @SecAzar, his boss, after trashing him on T.V.?....

149	2020-05-17 19:28:57+00:00	The Obama Administration is turning out to be one of the most corrupt and incompetent in U.S. history. Remember, he and Sleepy Joe are the reasons I am in the White House!!!

He knew EVERYTHING. Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more talk!

212	2020-05-13 14:33:15+00:00	As I have said for a long time, dealing with China is a very expensive thing to do. We just made a great Trade Deal, the ink was barely dry, and the World was hit by the Plague from China. 100 Trade Deals wouldn’t make up the difference - and all those innocent lives lost!
213	2020-05-13 14:16:58+00:00	When the so-called “rich guys” speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?

227	2020-05-12 11:56:26+00:00	Remember this, every Governor who has sky high approval on their handling of the Coronavirus, and I am happy for them all, could in no way have gotten those numbers, or had that success, without me and the Federal Governments help. From Ventilators to Testing, we made it happen!
228	2020-05-12 11:45:01+00:00	So interesting to see all of these people I beat so badly, pundits & consultants that never had a chance, telling me how to run for office. Many are Republicans who should LOVE our 280 new Judges, rebuilt Military, 2A, great V.A. Low Taxes, etc. Just don’t like that I beat them!
229	2020-05-12 11:35:12+00:00	Our Testing is the BEST in the World, by FAR! Numbers are coming down in most parts of our Country, which wants to open and get going again. It is happening, safely!

236	2020-05-12 10:54:00+00:00	When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn’t it obvious? What’s happening now? A total nut job!

260	2020-05-11 14:26:25+00:00	The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don’t play politics. Be safe, move quickly!

267	2020-05-11 02:41:47+00:00	Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by “Concast” (NBC) for this fraud. He knew exactly what he was doing. Public Airwaves = Fake News! @AjitPaiFCC @FCC
268	2020-05-11 02:10:59+00:00	He got caught, OBAMAGATE!

I guess they want to do business in China!

283	2020-05-10 11:48:52+00:00	We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic, especially the very early BAN of people from China, the infectious source, entering the USA. Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls - didn’t have a clue!
284	2020-05-10 11:47:36+00:00	When are the Fake Journalists, who received unwarranted Pulitzer Prizes for Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Scam, going to turn in their tarnished awards so they can be given to the real journalists who got it right. I’ll give you the names, there are plenty of them!
285	2020-05-10 11:44:59+00:00	A great man for Washington! Will Drain the Swamp!
286	2020-05-10 11:44:29+00:00	So great to see our Country starting to open up again!

CA25 Rigged Election!
297	2020-05-09 19:06:38+00:00	Starting early next week, at my order, the USA will be purchasing, from our Farmers, Ranchers & Specialty Crop Growers, 3 Billion Dollars worth of Dairy, Meat & Produce for Food Lines & Kitchens. “FARMERS TO FAMILY FOOD BOX” Great news for all! @SecretarySonny @ZippyDuvall
298	2020-05-09 18:51:12+00:00	Why is it that all of the political pundits & consultants that I beat so easily & badly, people that charged their clients far more than their services were worth, have become so totally “unhinged” when it come to your favorite President, me.

304	2020-05-09 15:45:02+00:00	So in California, the Democrats, who fought like crazy to get all mail in only ballots, and succeeded, have just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State. They are trying to steal another election. It’s all rigged out there. These votes must not count. SCAM!
305	2020-05-08 21:50:40+00:00	Vote @MikeGarcia2020 by May 12th! His opponent @ChristyforCA25 voted to fire teachers, and cut their salaries while bumping up her pay. Now she’s mocking our Great Vets! We need Navy Fighter Pilot Mike Garcia in #CA25!

334	2020-05-05 18:50:20+00:00	Wow! Congratulations to Greg Gutfeld, a one time Trump Hater who has come all the way home. His Ratings easily beat no talent Stephen Colbert, nice guy Jimmy Fallon, and wacko “last placer” Jimmy Kimmel. Greg built his show from scratch, and did a great job in doing so. @FoxNews
335	2020-05-05 18:37:54+00:00	Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities, Payroll Taxes, and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes, must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification & business deductions for restaurants & ent.
336	2020-05-05 18:18:26+00:00	Most of the money raised by the RINO losers of the so-called “Lincoln Project”, goes into their own pockets. With what I’ve done on Judges, Taxes, Regulations, Healthcare, the Military, Vets (Choice!) & protecting our great 2A, they should love Trump. Problem is, I BEAT THEM ALL!

338	2020-05-05 16:55:29+00:00	The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader, the Fake News Lamestream Media, are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country. No matter what we do or say, no matter how big a win, they report that it was a loss, or not good enough. The Enemy of the People!
339	2020-05-05 16:52:10+00:00	"For the constant criticism from the Do Nothing Democrats and their Fake News partners, here is the newest chart on our great testing “miracle"" compared to other countries. Dems and LameStream Media should be proud of the USA, instead of always ripping us down!"
340	2020-05-05 13:13:29+00:00	Governors should let roads and highway construction begin before heavy traffic starts, which will be soon. Some Governors never stopped, which proved to be very smart. They built and fixed roads during long no traffic periods. Also, saved big dollars!

Steve Schmidt & Reed Galvin lost for John McCain, Romney’s campaign manager (?) lost big to “O”, & Jennifer Horn got thrown out of the New Hampshire Republican Party. They’re all LOSERS, but Abe Lincoln, Republican, is all smiles!
345	2020-05-05 04:46:34+00:00	....because they don’t know how to win, and their so-called Lincoln Project is a disgrace to Honest Abe.

350	2020-05-04 22:35:02+00:00	A great new book, “Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage” by former Navy Seal, and current Texas Congressman @DanCrenshawTX, is now available. A fantastic guy — get your copy today!
351	2020-05-04 14:24:08+00:00	Interesting? By Congress not wanting the special 5 minute testing apparatus, they are saying that they are not “essential”. In any event, we have great testing capacity, and have performed 6.5 million tests, which is more than every country in the world, combined!
352	2020-05-04 13:42:13+00:00	Mexico is sadly experiencing very big CoronaVirus problems, and now California, get this, doesn’t want people coming over the Southern Border. A Classic! They are sooo lucky that I am their President. Border is very tight and the Wall is rapidly being built!
353	2020-05-04 13:36:33+00:00	Republicans love the biggest Tax Cuts, Rebuilt Military, Choice for Vets, saving 2nd Amendment and many other things my Administration has done, but what they love beyond all else is 252 (so far!) Federal Judges, not including two great Supreme Court Justices. A Big Record!
354	2020-05-04 12:31:46+00:00	And I’m Endorsing you also Lacy, you truly deserve it. You are doing a great job, and Omar is a disaster who wants much higher taxes, hates our Military & our Vets, demands Open Borders, and is fighting to take away our great 2nd Amendment. Good luck Lacy!
355	2020-05-04 12:19:45+00:00	Getting great reviews, finally, for how well we are handling the pandemic, especially our strong production of desperately needed ventilators, the building of field hospitals & beds, and soon, the great things we are doing on testing. People are really working well together!
356	2020-05-04 10:38:11+00:00	“Concast” should open up a long overdue Florida Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough. I know him and Crazy Mika well, used them beautifully in the last Election, dumped them nicely, and will state on the record that he is “nuts”. Besides, bad ratings! #OPENJOECOLDCASE

361	2020-05-03 20:18:19+00:00	....Fake News got it wrong again, as always, and tens of thousands of lives were saved by my EARLY BAN of China into our Country. The people that we’re allowed were heavily scrutinized and tested U.S. citizens, and as such, I welcome them with open arms!
362	2020-05-03 20:18:19+00:00	Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner...
363	2020-05-03 18:10:00+00:00	Thank you very much to our beautiful “boaters.” I will never let you down!
364	2020-05-03 14:43:31+00:00	....And then came a Plague, a great and powerful Plague, and the World was never to be the same again! But America rose from this death and destruction, always remembering its many lost souls, and the lost souls all over the World, and became greater than ever before!
365	2020-05-03 14:36:19+00:00	So nice to see this great honor. Thank you (but haven’t played golf in a long time)!
366	2020-05-03 14:30:44+00:00	Going well despite the Fake News!

377	2020-05-02 23:04:53+00:00	No reason to turn it down, except politics. We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work!
378	2020-05-02 23:00:39+00:00	The Democrats are just, as always, looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive, even in times of crisis. They don’t want to blame their cash cow, China, for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr. Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon! #DONOTHINGDEMOCRATS
379	2020-05-02 22:32:38+00:00	Not much time to sleep. Thank you!
380	2020-05-02 22:26:23+00:00	So true, although Honest Abe wasn’t bad. Thank you!
381	2020-05-02 21:51:30+00:00	She was thrown off The View like a dog, Zero T.V. Personas. Now Wallace is a 3rd rate lapdog for Fake News MSDNC (Concast). Doesn’t have what it takes!

384	2020-05-02 21:14:35+00:00	Border Wall is going up FAST. Over 172 miles already built. 450 miles by early next year, or sooner! Dems want OPEN BORDERS. I want STRONG BORDERS!
385	2020-05-02 21:07:34+00:00	The Impeachment Hoax will be exposed. Crazy Nancy gets Nothing Done, that’s why she got thrown out as Speaker the first time. Also, she should come back to Washington now!
386	2020-05-02 20:49:24+00:00	I hate to be promoting AT&T, but @OANN is Great News, not Fake News. Everybody should be carrying them!
387	2020-05-02 20:36:12+00:00	That’s right Jack. Keep up the good work!

392	2020-05-02 13:17:42+00:00	96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Also, just out, highest ever Approval Rating overall in the new Gallup Poll, and shows “Trump beating Sleepy Joe Biden.”
393	2020-05-02 13:06:53+00:00	There is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday. Likewise the House, which should return but isn’t because of Crazy Nancy P. The 5 minute Abbott Test will be used. Please inform Dr. Brian P. Monahan. @MarkMeadows

401	2020-05-01 15:27:29+00:00	Concast (@NBCNews) and Fake News @CNN are going out of their way to say GREAT things about China. They are Chinese puppets who want to do business there. They use USA airwaves to help China. The Enemy of the People!
402	2020-05-01 12:42:23+00:00	The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.
403	2020-05-01 12:14:36+00:00	Cryin Chuck Schumer, compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states, has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser, the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo & most others can’t stand him. AOC!
404	2020-05-01 12:07:51+00:00	Cryin’ Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over & over again. “We don’t have enough testing ,” he would repeat, when he knows we have done a great job on Testing, just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied, gave NY SALT. Run AOC!
405	2020-05-01 11:55:42+00:00	Dirty Cop!
406	2020-05-01 11:54:13+00:00	I have done more for farmers and ranchers than any President in history, and it has been my honor in doing so!

408	2020-05-01 00:23:04+00:00	Vote @MikeGarcia2020 by May 12th! His opponent @ChristyforCA25 voted to fire teachers, and cut their salaries while bumping up her pay. Now she’s mocking our Great Vets! We need Navy Fighter Pilot Mike Garcia in #CA25!
409	2020-05-01 00:11:06+00:00	....He is Strong on Crime, the Border, and Second Amendment. Tom has deep roots in Wisconsin, is a big Tax Cutter, and will help me DRAIN THE SWAMP! Tom has my Complete and Total Endorsement. Vote for Tom Tiffany!

412	2020-04-30 14:09:10+00:00	We can’t let the Fake News, and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, get away with stealing the Election. They tried that in 2016. How did that work out?
413	2020-04-30 12:53:30+00:00	The Do Nothing Democrats!
414	2020-04-30 12:31:39+00:00	FAKE NEWS!

417	2020-04-30 11:56:44+00:00	FAKE POLLING, just like 2016 (but worse)!
418	2020-04-30 11:47:47+00:00	What happened to General Michael Flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!
419	2020-04-30 11:47:04+00:00	Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone, a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe), was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred &amp; bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!
420	2020-04-30 11:45:41+00:00	Despite reports to the contrary, Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207), Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!
421	2020-04-30 04:41:15+00:00	Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC!
422	2020-04-30 04:23:59+00:00	I must admit that Lyin’ Brian Williams is, while dumber than hell, quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN “anchorman” Don Lemon, the “dumbest man on television”. Then you have Psycho Joe “What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?” Scarborough, another of the low I.Q. individuals!
423	2020-04-30 04:09:52+00:00	Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He’s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!
424	2020-04-30 04:01:08+00:00	Just told that Fake News @CNN is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. Actually, he is doing a great job, I never shouted at him (been with me for years, including the 2016 win), &amp; have no intention to do so. Just FAKE NEWS!
425	2020-04-30 03:52:46+00:00	.@CNN doesn’t want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn &amp; why they got the story so wrong. They, along with others, should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man &amp; his family. They won’t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
426	2020-04-30 03:11:27+00:00

430	2020-04-29 14:55:22+00:00	No, I think Amash would make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his Congressional seat. He almost always votes for the Do Nothing Dems anyway. I like him even more than Jill Stein!
431	2020-04-29 14:42:56+00:00	THANK YOU @MarkLevinShow!
432	2020-04-29 13:09:39+00:00	At least they admit it. The Failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost never correct their Fake Reporting!
433	2020-04-29 04:23:38+00:00	The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!
434	2020-04-29 02:39:07+00:00	THANK YOU MICHAEL! @bittyandbeaus

441	2020-04-28 12:06:03+00:00	We are doing far more, and better, Testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done, the same as with the Ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe!
442	2020-04-28 02:54:29+00:00	Because Shifty is a crooked politician!

445	2020-04-27 14:41:11+00:00	Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?
446	2020-04-27 13:48:07+00:00	FAKE NEWS, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
447	2020-04-27 13:41:01+00:00	There has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!
448	2020-04-27 12:20:41+00:00	Blame the Democrats for any “lateness” in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly, they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen, especially with many states which have old computers.
449	2020-04-27 01:42:10+00:00	So true!
450	2020-04-27 01:06:17+00:00	American citizens! We were long ahead of Dems, who were all against the BAN.
451	2020-04-27 00:59:33+00:00	Great!
452	2020-04-27 00:22:26+00:00	They are one of the worst in the “news” business. Total slime balls!
453	2020-04-27 00:19:55+00:00	They asked me to be at West Point on June 13th., & I will be there!
454	2020-04-27 00:14:39+00:00	Laura, just another Fake News Report!
455	2020-04-26 22:54:17+00:00	Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.” Does sarcasm ever work?
456	2020-04-26 21:53:32+00:00	Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be “fired” by me are Fake News. The Lamestream Media knows this, but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos &amp; havoc in the minds of the public. They never even called to ask. Alex is doing an excellent job!
457	2020-04-26 21:21:03+00:00	....fraud @donnabrazile (and others who are even worse). Chris Wallace is nastier to Republicans than even Deface the Nation or Sleepy Eyes. The people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!
458	2020-04-26 21:21:02+00:00	....Even the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats laughed at the Fox suggestion. No respect for the people running @FoxNews. But Fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct. They put RINO Paul Ryan on their Board. They hire “debate questions to Crooked Hillary”....
459	2020-04-26 21:21:02+00:00	.@FoxNews just doesn’t get what’s happening! They are being fed Democrat talking points, and they play them without hesitation or research. They forgot that Fake News @CNN &amp; MSDNC wouldn’t let @FoxNews participate, even a little bit, in the poor ratings Democrat Debates.....
460	2020-04-26 18:28:35+00:00	....schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me. I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night & read & see that I am angrily eating a hamburger & Diet Coke in my bedroom. People with me are always stunned. Anything to demean!
461	2020-04-26 18:28:35+00:00	I work from early in the morning until late at night, haven’t left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals, Military Rebuilding etc., and then I read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work....
462	2020-04-26 18:21:24+00:00	The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am the hardest working President in history. I don’t know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!
463	2020-04-26 17:42:04+00:00	.@CardinalDolan Thank you for a great call yesterday with Catholic Leaders, and a great Service today from @StPatsNYC!
464	2020-04-26 16:06:42+00:00	Happy Birthday to Melania, our great First Lady!
465	2020-04-26 01:06:20+00:00	Had a great call with Catholic Leaders and Educators earlier today. I will be online tomorrow at 10:15 A.M. (Eastern) for Sunday Mass celebrated by @CardinalDolan at St. Patrick’s Cathedral (@StPatsNYC) in New York City. Join me: https://saintpatrickscathedral.org/live
466	2020-04-25 22:23:30+00:00	I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out & embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!
467	2020-04-25 22:17:13+00:00	Remember, the Cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful, be safe, use common sense!
468	2020-04-25 22:01:41+00:00	What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!
469	2020-04-25 20:30:42+00:00	Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking & asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt & sick!
470	2020-04-25 15:59:22+00:00	If the Wall Street Journal “Editorial” writers had called, as they should have, they would have easily found that I was “NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night.” You said the opposite, and got it wrong as you often do!
471	2020-04-25 15:06:08+00:00	The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a “Hoax”, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with “one person from China”, and then grew, & will be a “Miracle” end!
472	2020-04-25 14:57:29+00:00	We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World, and even more than all major countries combined!
473	2020-04-25 14:51:54+00:00	It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators, many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines, and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!
474	2020-04-25 14:10:21+00:00	Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators, and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!
475	2020-04-25 12:59:20+00:00	Many testing sites are, and have been, open & available. Just passed 5 Million Tests, far more than any other country in the world. In fact, more than all other major countries combined! Don’t believe the Fake News!
476	2020-04-25 12:45:55+00:00	Thank you to the people of Colorado for the warm and gracious notes and letters sent to me for all of the Ventilators we got for you. It was my great honor! @SenCoryGardner
477	2020-04-25 12:20:16+00:00	.@TripleH is a total winner!
478	2020-04-25 12:14:56+00:00	Thank you to William Perry Pendley of the Bureau of Land Management. Great job on @TuckerCarlson describing some of the most beautiful land in the world! @FoxNews
479	2020-04-24 20:51:16+00:00	I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
480	2020-04-24 20:13:18+00:00	
481	2020-04-24 19:08:09+00:00	I will never let our Post Office fail. It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great, and we’re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!
482	2020-04-24 14:59:34+00:00	Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!
483	2020-04-24 14:59:05+00:00	Just spoke to President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the Republic of Honduras. We work closely together on the Southern Border. Will be helping him with his request for Ventilators and Testing.
484	2020-04-24 14:49:41+00:00	Great News! Randall Stephenson, the CEO of heavily indebted AT&T, which owns and presides over Fake News @CNN, is leaving, or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage “network” do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!
485	2020-04-24 14:40:20+00:00	I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, &amp; barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (&amp; USA)!
486	2020-04-24 14:20:08+00:00	Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!
487	2020-04-24 14:12:23+00:00	Just spoke to my friend, President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators, which we will provide. Great cooperation between us!
488	2020-04-24 13:53:25+00:00	Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!
489	2020-04-24 13:46:48+00:00	The Fake and totally corrupt News is after her as a means of getting to me. She’s smart and strong, knows the truth. Already a heroine to many!
490	2020-04-24 13:38:16+00:00	Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!
491	2020-04-24 04:29:53+00:00	Important news!
492	2020-04-24 04:17:52+00:00	Disgraceful. Should join the Republican Party!

515	2020-04-23 12:12:30+00:00	Thank you to Harvard and all others!

518	2020-04-22 14:17:08+00:00	CDC Director was totally misquoted by Fake News @CNN on Covid 19. He will be putting out a statement.
519	2020-04-22 14:14:38+00:00	Another FALSE ad by the Do Nothing Democrats. Almost all of their ads are False or Misleading, and the Fake News loves it!
520	2020-04-22 14:01:55+00:00	Sleepy Joe thought this was OK. Not me!
521	2020-04-22 12:08:05+00:00	I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.
522	2020-04-22 11:53:54+00:00	States are safely coming back. Our Country is starting to OPEN FOR BUSINESS again. Special care is, and always will be, given to our beloved seniors (except me!). Their lives will be better than ever...WE LOVE YOU ALL!
523	2020-04-22 11:03:26+00:00	Happy Birthday to the great Cindy Adams of the New York Post. Cindy is 90, but looks 39 to me. She is going strong!
524	2020-04-22 11:00:16+00:00	I will be signing my Executive Order prohibiting immigration into our Country today. In the meantime, even without this order, our Southern Border, aided substantially by the 170 miles of new Border Wall & 27,000 Mexican soldiers, is very tight - including for human trafficking!
525	2020-04-22 10:50:19+00:00	“Economic impact of Covid-19.” @foxandfriends Very interesting analysis. Light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you!
526	2020-04-22 03:36:31+00:00	Harvard should give back the money now. Their whole “endowment” system should be looked at!
527	2020-04-21 20:33:35+00:00	Great new book just out by the Former Director of Ice, Tom Homan: “Defend the Border and Save Lives: Solving Our Most Important Humanitarian and Security Crisis.” Great guy, get your copy today!
528	2020-04-21 19:59:55+00:00	I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!

530	2020-04-21 16:49:12+00:00	I urge the Senate and House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act with additional funding for PPP, Hospitals, and Testing. After I sign this Bill, we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief....
531	2020-04-21 13:33:34+00:00	We will never let the great U.S. Oil & Gas Industry down. I have instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future!
532	2020-04-21 11:15:57+00:00	96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! This must also mean that, most importantly, we are doing a good (great) job in the handling of the Pandemic.
533	2020-04-21 10:57:36+00:00	I’ve had great “ratings” my whole life, there’s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are “through the roof”(Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale , @nytimes) but I don’t care about that. I care about going around the Fake News to the PEOPLE!
534	2020-04-21 10:40:33+00:00	It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day, and all night. Either I’m really good, far better than the Fake News wants to admit, or they don’t have nearly the power as once thought!
535	2020-04-21 10:19:15+00:00	Watched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated Morning Psycho on MSDNC just to see if he is as “nuts” as people are saying. He’s worse. Such hatred and contempt! I used to do his show all the time before the 2016 election, then cut him off. Wasn’t worth the effort, his mind is shot!
536	2020-04-21 03:18:19+00:00	Great Alan. They are Fake News!

538	2020-04-21 02:06:22+00:00	In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!

544	2020-04-20 15:37:22+00:00	... “Testing, Testing, Testing,” again playing a very dangerous political game. States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!
545	2020-04-20 15:37:22+00:00	Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, “Ventilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.” They screamed it loud & clear, & thought they had us cold, even though it was the State’s task. But everyone got their V’s, with many to spare. Now they scream....
546	2020-04-20 14:32:12+00:00	Received a very nice call from @GovTimWalz of Minnesota. We are working closely on getting him all he needs, and fast. Good things happening!
547	2020-04-20 13:58:46+00:00	Congratulations to all of my many friends at The Villages in Florida on having done so well, and with such great spirit, during these rather unusual times. So proud of everyone! Mark Morse & Gary Lester have really stepped up to the plate. Hope to see everyone soon.

554	2020-04-19 19:14:26+00:00	.@FoxNews “Dems say President Trump is trying to open the United States Economy too quickly”, but, if I took even a little more time, they would loudly chant that I am moving too slowly. Just political talking points for them. For me it’s about lives &amp; the future of our Country!
555	2020-04-19 16:58:51+00:00	Nervous Nancy is an inherently “dumb” person. She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as “Speaker”. Wallace & @FoxNews are on a bad path, watch!
556	2020-04-19 16:36:26+00:00	Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the “King of Ventilators”, other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!
557	2020-04-19 13:47:19+00:00	Great credit must be given to @FEMA and all of those that are helping our States make it big!
558	2020-04-19 13:44:09+00:00	Look forward to this!

563	2020-04-18 19:03:09+00:00	I gave up on Drudge (a really nice guy) long ago, as have many others. People are dropping off like flies!
564	2020-04-18 18:22:18+00:00	The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media, by far, is “sources say”, or “officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity”, or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn’t even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!

This is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!
566	2020-04-18 17:20:28+00:00	....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus, but nothing that anyone could have said, including “it’s over”, could have made....
567	2020-04-18 17:20:23+00:00	No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats, no matter how GREAT a job you are doing, they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative, even in a time of crisis. I thought it would be different, but it’s not. In fact, it’s even worse...
568	2020-04-18 17:05:13+00:00	Great news, thank you!
569	2020-04-18 17:01:32+00:00	Thank you @Honeywell, great job!

Last night had a very gold conversation with the President of Mexico on numerous topics. Border is very strong!
574	2020-04-18 03:50:31+00:00	An incompetent political hack! Come back to Washington & take care of our great American workers.
575	2020-04-18 03:47:48+00:00	This is a disgraceful situation!
576	2020-04-18 03:42:23+00:00	Lamestream Media is only getting worse!
577	2020-04-18 03:40:31+00:00	Cut him off now!
578	2020-04-18 03:38:07+00:00	Great book. Get it and support Charlie!

581	2020-04-17 17:00:01+00:00	Cuomo ridiculously wanted “40 thousand Ventilators”. We gave him a small fraction of that number, and it was plenty. State should have had them in stockpile!
582	2020-04-17 16:32:43+00:00	The States have to step up their TESTING!
583	2020-04-17 16:30:05+00:00	China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!
584	2020-04-17 16:25:30+00:00	Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also, don’t forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!
585	2020-04-17 16:11:45+00:00	....testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help and equipment than any other state, by far, & these great men & women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action!
586	2020-04-17 16:11:45+00:00	Governor Cuomo should spend more time “doing” and less time “complaining”. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking! We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn’t need or use, gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped you with....
587	2020-04-17 15:25:45+00:00	LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!

590	2020-04-17 13:50:31+00:00	Today people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!
591	2020-04-17 13:20:29+00:00	....in January and February, as the Virus spread globally? Why did the W.H.O. wait as long as it did to take decisive action? Lanhee Chen, Hoover Institution Fellow @FoxNews
592	2020-04-17 13:20:29+00:00	Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading....

Our military deployments in the Caribbean & Eastern Pacific will endure until these threats are neutralized!
609	2020-04-14 14:57:19+00:00	Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!
610	2020-04-14 14:24:51+00:00	GET RID OF BALLOT HARVESTING, IT IS RAMPANT WITH FRAUD. THE USA MUST HAVE VOTER I.D., THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN HONEST COUNT!
611	2020-04-14 14:07:11+00:00	Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!

618	2020-04-13 20:31:30+00:00	First the Fake News Media said that it’s not fair for the President of the United States to be giving news conferences, but it is the only way I can reach the American People, as seen in the below poll.

620	2020-04-13 14:53:52+00:00	....It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!
621	2020-04-13 14:53:50+00:00	For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect....
622	2020-04-13 13:31:20+00:00	....disaster, the Energy Industry will be strong again, far faster than currently anticipated. Thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track, in particular Russia and Saudi Arabia.
623	2020-04-13 13:31:19+00:00	Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19.....
624	2020-04-13 02:08:16+00:00	The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!
625	2020-04-13 01:16:50+00:00	I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy, the hard part is WHY?

632	2020-04-12 21:43:10+00:00	Governors, get your states testing programs & apparatus perfected. Be ready, big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing more than any country in the World. Also, gear up with Face Masks!
633	2020-04-12 21:33:34+00:00	The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, have put their political game plan in full swing. “Whether he is right or wrong, it doesn’t matter. Criticize ’Trump’ for everything, and don’t let the public see Biden. Hide him.”
634	2020-04-12 20:43:12+00:00	If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that President Trump “ignored early warnings about the threat,” then why did Media & Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said “early & not necessary.” Corrupt Media!
635	2020-04-12 19:49:37+00:00	Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe, Chris Wallace, on @FoxNews. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!), or the people over at Deface the Nation. What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. It’s a whole new ballgame over there!
636	2020-04-12 19:40:03+00:00	The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!
637	2020-04-12 19:25:35+00:00	For the first time in history there is a fully signed Presidential Disaster Declaration for all 50 States. We are winning, and will win, the war on the Invisible Enemy!

641	2020-04-12 16:14:52+00:00	Great businessman & philanthropist Bernie Marcus, Co-Founder of Home Depot, said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer
642	2020-04-12 14:21:55+00:00	HAPPY EASTER!
643	2020-04-12 14:21:03+00:00	A very good sign is that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent. We deployed 418 Doctors, Nurses and Respiratory Therapists from the hospital ship Comfort and the Javits Convention Center to hospitals in NYC & State. Have more bed capacity than was needed. Good!
644	2020-04-12 12:06:04+00:00	HAPPY EASTER!

648	2020-04-11 23:51:58+00:00	Will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews!
649	2020-04-11 23:34:58+00:00	So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!
650	2020-04-11 23:28:18+00:00	Governor @GavinNewsom of California has been very nice &amp; highly supportive about the great job we have done, working together, for California. That is the good news, but this is the bad. He is unfairly under attack by the Radical Left Dems, MSDNC etc. He is strong! Will he fold?
651	2020-04-11 22:38:29+00:00	I will be watching. HAVE A GREAT EASTER!
652	2020-04-11 22:35:35+00:00	The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn’t have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs & Trade are losers for the U.S., but winners for other countries, including China. If we followed their standards, we’d have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!
653	2020-04-11 21:53:36+00:00	Watching @FoxNews on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time. We now have some great alternatives, like @OANN.
654	2020-04-11 21:48:58+00:00	“The President and the Federal Government are doing an excellent job. When they say the death toll isn’t going to be as high as reported, they (the opposition) act like they’re sad because it’s lower. I think they are (Press Conferences) wonderful.” West Virginia Resident, C Span
655	2020-04-11 21:36:48+00:00	Great editorial by @SenRonJohnson!
656	2020-04-11 21:08:43+00:00	Wishing all a safe and blessed Easter Sunday. I will be tuning into Pastor @robertjeffress at http://firstdallas.org/liveworship Church in Dallas, Texas tomorrow morning at 10:20 AM Eastern.

658	2020-04-11 18:47:39+00:00	....Does anyone ever notice how few quotes from an actual person are given nowadays by the Lamestream Media. Very seldom. The unnamed or anonymous sources are almost always FAKE NEWS.
659	2020-04-11 18:43:03+00:00	When the Failing @nytimes or Amazon @washingtonpost writes a story saying “unnamed sources said”, or any such phrase where a person’s name is not used, don’t believe them. Most of these unnamed sources don’t exist. They are made up to defame &amp; disparage. They have no “source”...

This is unprecedented, it is unsettling and challenging but, we will rise to meet the occasion.” MACK MCLARTY, Clinton White House Chief of Staff. @LelandVittert @FoxNews Thank you Mack. We will be bigger, better and stronger than ever before!

664	2020-04-10 15:42:10+00:00	Nobody wants to say that if Elizabeth Warren gets out of the race before Super Tuesday, Crazy Bernie Sanders wins virtually every state in a blowout...NOT EVEN CLOSE! I haven’t heard one member of the Fake News Establishment even mention this irrefutable fact. FAKE NEWS!
665	2020-04-10 15:15:25+00:00	The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat!
666	2020-04-10 14:36:41+00:00	Because the T.V. Ratings for the White House News Conference’s are the highest, the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media), the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats &, of course, the few remaining RINO’S, are doing everything in their power to disparage & end them. The People’s Voice!

671	2020-04-10 11:48:26+00:00	Congress must go back to DEDUCTIBILITY by businesses if Restaurants, Clubs & Entertaiment is expected to flourish (like never before)!
672	2020-04-10 11:32:26+00:00	Democrats are blocking a 251 Billion Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason, with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts & more. Big Economic Bounceback!
673	2020-04-10 11:30:20+00:00	This week, in only 4 days, we had the biggest Stock Market increase since 1974. We have a great chance for the really big bounce when the Invisible Enemy is gone!

I expect Secretary Purdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable, strong, and safe....
679	2020-04-09 19:35:00+00:00	The Wall Street Journal always “forgets” to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are “through the roof” (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale, according to @nytimes) &amp; is only way for me to escape the Fake News &amp; get my views across. WSJ is Fake News!
680	2020-04-09 18:39:20+00:00	Great News: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just been moved out of Intensive Care. Get well Boris!!!
681	2020-04-09 15:51:56+00:00	On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we honor the more than 500,000 American warriors captured while protecting our way of life. We pay tribute to these Patriots for their unwavering and unrelenting spirit!
682	2020-04-09 15:08:05+00:00	.@OANN A key CoronaVirus Model is now predicting far fewer deaths than the number shown in earlier models. That’s because the American people are doing a great job. Social Distancing etc. Keep going!
683	2020-04-08 23:34:27+00:00	Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting, which is “RIPE for FRAUD,” and shouldn’t be allowed!
684	2020-04-08 23:15:03+00:00	This morning, 450,000 protective suits landed in Dallas, Texas. This was made possible because of the partnership of two great American companies—DuPont and FedEx—and our friends in Vietnam. Thank you! @DuPont_News @FedEx

693	2020-04-08 14:52:56+00:00	Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNTRY, and it will be sooner rather than later, the horror of the Invisible Enemy, except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend, must be quickly forgotten. Our Economy will BOOM, perhaps like never before!!!
694	2020-04-08 14:42:25+00:00	...the Fake News Media into not covering them, but that effort failed because the ratings are through the roof according to, of all sources, the Failing New York Times, “Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale” type numbers (& sadly, they get it $FREE). Trump Derangement Syndrome!
695	2020-04-08 14:42:24+00:00	The Radical Left Democrats have gone absolutely crazy that I am doing daily Presidential News Conferences. They actually want me to STOP! They used to complain that I am not doing enough of them, now they complain that I “shouldn’t be allowed to do them.” They tried to shame.....
696	2020-04-08 12:46:01+00:00	Will be immediately sending 100 Ventilators to Colorado at the request of Senator Gardner!
697	2020-04-08 12:20:48+00:00	Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends

706	2020-04-07 15:22:46+00:00	Why didn’t the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, V.P. & others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!
707	2020-04-07 15:04:16+00:00	The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?
708	2020-04-07 04:35:42+00:00	Vote today, Tuesday, for highly respected Republican, Justice Daniel Kelly. Tough on Crime, loves your Military, Vets, Farmers, & will save your 2nd Amendment. A BIG VOTE!

717	2020-04-06 15:34:27+00:00	Joe Biden wanted the date for the Democrat National Convention moved to a later time period. Now he wants a “Virtual” Convention, one where he doesn’t have to show up. Gee, I wonder why? Also, what ever happened to that phone call he told the Fake News he wanted to make to me?
718	2020-04-06 13:08:58+00:00	Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can’t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!
719	2020-04-06 11:55:14+00:00	LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!

721	2020-04-06 11:53:00+00:00	Thank you Gayle. I only wish the public could fully understand how corrupt & dishonest so much of our Lamestream Media is. My Press Conferences are vital. They are reaching millions of people that are not being told the truth, & haven’t been for years (Witch-Hunts, Fake News)!
722	2020-04-06 11:49:57+00:00	For humanitarian reasons, the passengers from the two CoronaVirus stricken cruise ships have been given medical treatment and, when appropriate, allowed to disembark, under strict supervision.

879	2020-03-23 16:05:53+00:00	A great early result from a drug that will start tomorrow in New York and other places! #COVIDー19
880	2020-03-23 14:28:42+00:00	The New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left. What should have been a good story got “worse & worse”, until the headline alone made it very unfair. Fake & Corrupt News that is very dangerous for our Country!
881	2020-03-23 14:16:00+00:00	THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!
882	2020-03-23 13:07:55+00:00	STRONG & UNITED, WE WILL PREVAIL! GOD BLESS THE USA!!
883	2020-03-23 13:02:30+00:00	
884	2020-03-23 11:59:50+00:00	Robert, we will end up stronger than ever before. Thank you!
885	2020-03-23 11:53:55+00:00	We will be guided by the wishes of Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of the United States and a man who has done a magnificent job on the Olympic Venue, as to attending the Olympic Games in Japan. He will make the proper decision!
886	2020-03-23 03:50:20+00:00	WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!
887	2020-03-23 03:28:00+00:00	I watch and listen to the Fake News, CNN, MSDNC, ABC, NBC, CBS, some of FOX (desperately & foolishly pleading to be politically correct), the @nytimes, &amp; the @washingtonpost, and all I see is hatred of me at any cost. Don’t they understand that they are destroying themselves?
888	2020-03-23 01:20:08+00:00	My friend (always there when I’ve needed him!), Senator @RandPaul, was just tested “positive” from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits.
889	2020-03-22 17:32:30+00:00	The hard working men and women of @UPS are working overtime to maintain our supply chain and deliver medical supplies to those in need. Your work is critical to the health of our nation, keep it up!
890	2020-03-22 16:14:59+00:00	.@JBPritzker, Governor of Illinois, and a very small group of certain other Governors, together with Fake News @CNN &amp; Concast (MSDNC), shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings. We are there to back you up should you fail, and always will be!
891	2020-03-22 14:52:09+00:00	Working very well with States and our Nation’s Governors. #TEAMWORK
892	2020-03-22 14:49:27+00:00	Thank you to Fred Smith and @FedEx for the rapid emergency deliveries you are making all over our Nation. Keep it going!
893	2020-03-22 14:25:16+00:00	Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are? @RepMarkMeadows @GOPLeader @senatemajldr
894	2020-03-22 10:11:38+00:00	So true!
895	2020-03-22 10:07:25+00:00	That doesn’t sound like Michael, does it?
896	2020-03-22 10:03:36+00:00	Maria is Great!
897	2020-03-22 03:56:31+00:00	
898	2020-03-22 03:46:46+00:00	Thank you @JennPellegrino @OANN

905	2020-03-21 14:13:08+00:00	HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. The FDA has moved mountains - Thank You! Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents).....
906	2020-03-21 13:21:10+00:00	Great story. Thank you to Mr. Young of Jonesboro, Arkansas!

909	2020-03-20 20:22:12+00:00	Today I spoke with our Nation’s Small Businesses, which employ nearly half of America’s workforce. We are taking the MOST aggressive action in history to deliver fast relief to your businesses and workers. We will always protect our Small Businesses! @SBAgov
910	2020-03-20 18:45:23+00:00	
911	2020-03-20 04:41:00+00:00	A Great Guy!
912	2020-03-20 04:37:18+00:00	Steve is one of the very best in the Senate. He is competing against a failed Democrat Presidential candidate who never got close to 1%, and was sent packing. Had to be talked into this run by Schumer. Bad for 2nd A! I strongly Endorse @SteveDaines!
913	2020-03-19 23:31:33+00:00	
914	2020-03-19 22:23:48+00:00	America’s Private Sector is stepping up to help us be STRONG! Many of the Nation’s distillers, large and small, are producing and donating hand sanitizer to help fight #COVID19. THANK YOU!
915	2020-03-19 22:16:29+00:00	THANK YOU to our Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and EMS who help us defeat the Virus every day. Our proud nation is grateful for the unwavering dedication and sacrifice of our First Responders and their families. TOGETHER we will beat this!
916	2020-03-19 22:13:19+00:00	THANK YOU! #ThankATrucker
917	2020-03-19 14:24:39+00:00	SOCIAL DISTANCING!
918	2020-03-19 12:54:47+00:00	We are going to WIN, sooner rather than later!
919	2020-03-18 21:48:42+00:00	STRONG & UNITED, WE WILL PREVAIL!
920	2020-03-18 21:37:22+00:00	I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!
921	2020-03-18 20:50:43+00:00	Thank you @HerschelWalker!
922	2020-03-18 20:49:33+00:00	Today I spoke with American physicians and nurses to thank them for their tireless work. Doctors and nurses are at the front lines of this war and are true American HEROES! With their help, America will WIN.
923	2020-03-18 19:14:46+00:00	...It cannot overcome the dedication of our doctors, nurses, and scientists — and it cannot beat the LOVE, PATRIOTISM, and DETERMINATION of our citizens. Strong and United, WE WILL PREVAIL!
924	2020-03-18 19:14:46+00:00	I want all Americans to understand: we are at war with an invisible enemy, but that enemy is no match for the spirit and resolve of the American people...
925	2020-03-18 18:40:10+00:00	15 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD!
926	2020-03-18 15:45:55+00:00	Thank you to our great American businesses for going above and beyond to keep our most vulnerable citizens safe!
927	2020-03-18 13:37:46+00:00	We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!
928	2020-03-18 13:30:02+00:00	....Also, according to the Daily Caller, leading Sleepy Joe Biden in Florida, 48% to 42%.
929	2020-03-18 13:29:58+00:00	95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, 53% overall. Not bad considering I get nothing but Fake & Corrupt News, day and night. “Russia, Russia, Russia”, then “the Ukraine Scam (where’s the Whistleblower?)”, the “Impeachment Hoax”, and more, more, more....
930	2020-03-18 13:16:07+00:00	The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG
931	2020-03-18 11:46:33+00:00	I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!
932	2020-03-18 11:12:49+00:00	I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!
933	2020-03-18 10:53:58+00:00	I will totally protect your Medicare & Social Security!
934	2020-03-18 10:41:14+00:00	For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!
935	2020-03-17 20:12:55+00:00	
936	2020-03-17 19:31:33+00:00	The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!
937	2020-03-17 13:34:01+00:00	Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS
938	2020-03-17 13:27:18+00:00	Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!
939	2020-03-17 12:22:11+00:00	Cuomo wants “all states to be treated the same.” But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big “hotspot”, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it....
940	2020-03-17 03:27:51+00:00	The “Times” is a disgrace to journalism!
941	2020-03-17 03:19:49+00:00	Great news Lindsey!
942	2020-03-16 22:51:54+00:00	The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!
943	2020-03-16 20:29:46+00:00	I ask all Americans to band together and support your neighbors by not hoarding unnecessary amounts of food and essentials. TOGETHER we will stay STRONG and overcome this challenge!
944	2020-03-16 20:29:30+00:00	Yesterday I spoke with the great American Grocers and Supply Chain Executives. We are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. These beacons of our community will remain open for you, no matter what. We are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!
945	2020-03-16 20:16:34+00:00	
946	2020-03-16 20:16:23+00:00	
947	2020-03-16 18:32:44+00:00	Just had a very good tele-conference with Nation’s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to “do more”.
948	2020-03-16 15:00:41+00:00	Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!
949	2020-03-16 12:41:22+00:00	God Bless the USA!
950	2020-03-16 03:34:33+00:00	
951	2020-03-16 02:51:02+00:00	I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That’s what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!
952	2020-03-15 22:53:05+00:00	The individual Governors of States, and local officials, must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights, working in conjunction with @CDCgov and the Federal Government!
953	2020-03-15 18:08:35+00:00	The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these, they are not truthful. Watch for their apology, it won’t happen. More importantly, thank you to Google!
954	2020-03-15 17:29:03+00:00	So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has “lost” the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!
955	2020-03-15 17:09:50+00:00	Can’t believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court, and our two great Justices. If a Republican did that, there would be an endless price to pay. Pathetic!
956	2020-03-15 17:02:00+00:00	....The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!
957	2020-03-15 17:02:00+00:00	There will be a News Conference by the CoronaVirus Task Force today at the White House, 5 P.M. @VP We are working closely with the Governors of our Country’s great States, which are a very big factor. They are working hard, along with us, to get the job properly done.....
958	2020-03-15 16:34:23+00:00	We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!
959	2020-03-15 15:20:33+00:00	I am watching a great and beautiful service by Pastor Jentezen Franklin. Thank you! @Jentezen
960	2020-03-15 15:02:16+00:00	TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!
961	2020-03-15 14:58:31+00:00	Great Job by Judicial Watch. Potentially a treasure trove. Too bad you are not given more help, but it will all work out!
962	2020-03-15 14:49:20+00:00	This took place in the Rose Garden, just coming out of a cold Winter!
963	2020-03-15 14:45:29+00:00	Amazing how the Fake News never covers this. No Interest on Student Loans. The Dems are just talk!
964	2020-03-15 14:42:54+00:00	Thank you Sara. Keep writing, great talent!
965	2020-03-15 14:35:37+00:00	Thank you!

967	2020-03-14 23:03:49+00:00	Tomorrow I have called for a National Day of Prayer. I will be tuning in to Pastor @Jentezen at the @FreeChapel Church in Gainesville, Georgia at 11:00 AM EDT. God Bless the USA! http://freechapel.org/live
968	2020-03-14 19:13:34+00:00	The @CDCgov has published guidelines on http://CoronaVirus.gov to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families and their communities.
969	2020-03-14 19:06:09+00:00	Just had a nice conversation with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau of Canada. Great to hear that his wonderful wife Sophie is doing very well. The United States and Canada will continue to coordinate closely together on COVID-19.

976	2020-03-14 13:45:56+00:00	Attending meetings on Covid-19 in the White House. Working with States and local governments, many of whom have done a great job. Full report latter!

978	2020-03-14 12:02:56+00:00	Larry, I am not surprised that Candace was great. I would only be surprised if she wasn’t great!
979	2020-03-14 11:37:24+00:00	Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!
980	2020-03-14 01:27:54+00:00	To those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your Federal Government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people.
981	2020-03-14 00:42:32+00:00	....the health and well-being of American families FIRST. Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!
982	2020-03-14 00:42:32+00:00	....the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES! I will always put....
983	2020-03-14 00:42:25+00:00	I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers. I have directed....
984	2020-03-13 23:10:37+00:00	Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on earth...We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need, and that they are entitled to. No resource will be spared.
985	2020-03-13 22:54:37+00:00	....No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!
986	2020-03-13 22:54:36+00:00	It is my great honor to declare Sunday, March 15th as a National Day of Prayer. We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these....
987	2020-03-13 22:21:18+00:00	At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry – it will be kept that way!
988	2020-03-13 21:19:39+00:00	We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care they need. No resource will be spared!
989	2020-03-13 21:00:16+00:00	To unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort, today I am officially declaring a National Emergency.
990	2020-03-13 14:55:34+00:00	I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M., The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!
991	2020-03-13 14:52:59+00:00	To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!
992	2020-03-13 13:44:29+00:00	The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic & physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!
993	2020-03-13 12:30:48+00:00	If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!
994	2020-03-13 10:22:19+00:00	.... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!
995	2020-03-13 10:22:17+00:00	For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.....
996	2020-03-13 02:33:48+00:00	“The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Biden’s remarks, and any alarm that he might have caused, an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency, and that killed 12,000 Americans.” @LouDobbs
997	2020-03-13 02:20:56+00:00	Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!
998	2020-03-13 01:58:02+00:00	Just had a great conversation with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I told him that the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job, one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!

1005	2020-03-12 10:15:43+00:00	“Nancy Pelosi all of a sudden doesn’t like the payroll tax cut, but when Obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing that all of the working families would benefit from because if you get a paycheck, you’re going to take home more money.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends
1006	2020-03-12 02:13:32+00:00	Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats, and please remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.

1008	2020-03-11 22:04:26+00:00	The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy, actually, an enemy of the World, the CoronaVirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life & safety of the United States!
1009	2020-03-11 20:44:36+00:00	I will be addressing the Nation this evening at 9:00 P.M. (Eastern) from the Oval Office.
1010	2020-03-11 19:18:35+00:00	I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!
1011	2020-03-11 19:17:50+00:00	....We have the greatest healthcare system, experts, scientists and doctors anywhere in the world. Together, we will PREVAIL!
1012	2020-03-11 19:17:50+00:00	I want to thank all of our Great Government officials on the CoronaVirus Task Force who are working around the clock, in response to the CoronaVirus. Continue to check http://CDC.gov for updates, and follow all recommendations that are available....
1013	2020-03-11 18:52:45+00:00	....Together we are putting into policy a plan to prevent, detect, treat and create a vaccine against CoronaVirus to save lives in America and the world. America will get it done!
1014	2020-03-11 18:52:44+00:00	America is the Greatest Country in the world. We have the best scientists, doctors, nurses and health care professionals. They are amazing people who do phenomenal things every day....
1015	2020-03-11 18:50:10+00:00	Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn’t care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!
1016	2020-03-11 14:22:00+00:00	Vanity Fair Magazine, which will soon be out of business, and their third rate Fake reporters, who make up sources which don’t exist, wrote yet another phony & boring hit piece. The facts are just the opposite. Our team is doing a great job with CoronaVirus!
1017	2020-03-11 14:08:11+00:00	Thank you Gavin. Team is doing a great job!
1018	2020-03-11 05:32:35+00:00	THANK YOU IDAHO! #KAG2020
1019	2020-03-11 04:55:59+00:00	Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders. If she would have quit 3 days earlier, Sanders would have beaten Biden in a route, it wouldn’t even have been close. They also got two other losers to support Sleepy Joe!
1020	2020-03-11 03:28:10+00:00	THANK YOU WASHINGTON! #KAG2020
1021	2020-03-11 03:27:42+00:00	THANK YOU NORTH DAKOTA! #KAG2020
1022	2020-03-11 01:54:14+00:00	....(which is under siege), is strong on Crime and the Border, and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!
1023	2020-03-11 01:54:13+00:00	Tommy Tuberville (@TTuberville) is running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Alabama. Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University. He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment....
1024	2020-03-11 01:07:05+00:00	THANK YOU MICHIGAN! #KAG2020
1025	2020-03-11 00:55:26+00:00	THANK YOU MISSOURI! #KAG2020
1026	2020-03-11 00:52:39+00:00	THANK YOU MISSISSIPPI! #KAG2020
1027	2020-03-10 21:59:35+00:00	Best unemployment numbers in the history of our Country. Best employment number EVER, almost 160 million people working right now. Vote Republican, unless you want to see these numbers obliterated!
1028	2020-03-10 21:31:54+00:00	If you like automobiles, how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars, as quickly as possible, especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also, no more than one car per family. I, on the other hand, have new plants being built all over Michigan, Plus!
1029	2020-03-10 18:41:08+00:00	Great meeting on Capitol Hill with the @SenateGOP!
1030	2020-03-10 16:44:33+00:00	Thank you @SenateGOP!
1031	2020-03-10 14:48:18+00:00	Ronald Reagan’s great economist, the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, has just said great things about a Payroll Tax Cut!
1032	2020-03-10 14:44:11+00:00	Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!
1033	2020-03-10 14:42:24+00:00	Nancy Pelosi just said, “I don’t know if we can be ready this week.” In other words, it’s off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That’s been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!
1034	2020-03-10 14:28:57+00:00	There is another Russia, Russia, Russia meeting today. It is headed up by corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff, so I wouldn’t expect too much! @DHS_Wolf
1035	2020-03-10 14:02:12+00:00	The Federal Reserve must be a leader, not a very late follower, which it has been!
1036	2020-03-10 14:00:07+00:00	Our pathetic, slow moving Federal Reserve, headed by Jay Powell, who raised rates too fast and lowered too late, should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations. They now have as much as a two point advantage, with even bigger currency help. Also, stimulate!
1037	2020-03-10 13:48:19+00:00	Well deserved Jack. A great honor!
1038	2020-03-10 13:46:15+00:00	True, with number 1 being more important!
1039	2020-03-10 13:23:21+00:00	Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie!
1040	2020-03-10 11:36:36+00:00	Polls say they BOTH lose to “Trump”.
1041	2020-03-10 11:33:52+00:00	Wow! @foxandfriends blew away the competition of Morning Joke (which did very poorly) on MSDNC (Another Comcast sleaze production), and @CNN’s New Day, in the Morning Television Ratings. A total blowout, but that’s what you get when you treat “Trump” fairly!
1042	2020-03-10 11:08:03+00:00	Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!
1043	2020-03-10 04:49:44+00:00	Fake News!!
1044	2020-03-10 04:38:20+00:00	Oklahoma, Vote for your GREAT Senator Today. Nobody better than Jim!
1045	2020-03-09 21:36:08+00:00	THANK YOU, Jim, for your incredible support of our #MAGA Agenda! You are a tremendous Senator for the people of the Great State of Oklahoma and you have my Complete and Total Endorsement!
1046	2020-03-09 21:34:37+00:00	Congressman @StevenPalazzo is doing a fantastic job for the people of Mississippi. He strongly supports our #MAGA Agenda. Steven will continue to protect your #2A, &amp; Support our INCREDIBLE Vets &amp; Military. Steven has my Complete Endorsement. VOTE for Steven tomorrow, March 10th!
1047	2020-03-09 21:29:35+00:00	Congressman Michael Guest (@GuestCongress) is an incredible fighter for the Great State of Mississippi. Michael is strong on Crime and the Border, he loves our Military and Vets. Michael has my Complete and Total Endorsement! Get out and Vote for Michael tomorrow, March 10th!
1048	2020-03-09 14:47:59+00:00	So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!
1049	2020-03-09 14:36:50+00:00	Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!
1050	2020-03-09 14:36:49+00:00	Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!
1051	2020-03-09 13:17:12+00:00	So much FAKE NEWS!
1052	2020-03-09 13:16:05+00:00	The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world!
1053	2020-03-09 13:11:47+00:00	Great job being done by the @VP and the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you!
1054	2020-03-09 11:40:56+00:00	The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country!
1055	2020-03-09 11:39:35+00:00	“Trump has outmastered the Deep State. He’s light years ahead of us.” MSDNC. I disagree. We have a long way to go. There are still some very bad, sick people in our government - people who do not love our Country (In fact, they hate our Country!).
1056	2020-03-09 11:33:37+00:00	Now the Democrats are trying to smear Bernie with Russia, Russia, Russia. They are driving him Crazy!
1057	2020-03-09 11:30:18+00:00	Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?
1058	2020-03-09 11:24:52+00:00	Cryin’ Chuck Schumer said, “You will pay the price for this. You won’t know what HIT YOU.” That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.” Trouble ahead!
1059	2020-03-09 11:20:43+00:00	The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.”
1060	2020-03-09 11:10:47+00:00	A great book, support Charlie, BUY IT! Already Number One.
1061	2020-03-09 10:17:11+00:00	Working hard Lori!
1062	2020-03-09 05:25:11+00:00	There are no mixed messages, only political weaponization by people like you and your brother, Fredo!
1063	2020-03-08 22:18:35+00:00	Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!
1064	2020-03-08 16:23:39+00:00	The New York Times is an embarrassment to journalism. They were a dead paper before I went into politics, and they will be a dead paper after I leave, which will be in 5 years. Fake News is the Enemy of the people!
1065	2020-03-08 12:45:45+00:00	We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!
1066	2020-03-08 05:24:08+00:00	Thank you @SenatorTimScott!
1067	2020-03-08 04:42:08+00:00	.....least 5 States & the Nomination. Did the DNC & Dems tell Elizabeth Warren to wait? If so, they were deadly, the race would have been over, & Bernie would have won. Dirty double dealing? Nobody knows for sure, & history will be the judge. But I say, here we go AGAIN, Bernie!
1068	2020-03-08 04:42:07+00:00	We have now learned for sure that the Democrats don’t want anything to do with Crazy Bernie. Rigged? First @amyklobuchar &amp; @PeteButtigieg quit the race &amp; come out for Sleepy Joe BEFORE Super Tuesday. Pocahontas says NO &amp; quits race AFTER ELECTION, thereby depriving Bernie of at..
1069	2020-03-08 03:56:39+00:00	I agree with Joe!
1070	2020-03-08 03:47:31+00:00	Thank you to the Great State of Tennessee. We are with you all the way!
1071	2020-03-07 03:45:41+00:00	Thank you @GovBillLee and @MariaLeeTN. My Administration will always be there for the Great People of Tennessee. Together, we will prevail! https://twitter.com/MariaLeeTN/status/1236052152398876672
1072	2020-03-07 01:08:20+00:00	....I want to thank Acting Chief Mick Mulvaney for having served the Administration so well. He will become the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Thank you!
1073	2020-03-07 01:08:19+00:00	I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one....
1074	2020-03-07 00:19:02+00:00	Congratulations to @FoxNews!
1075	2020-03-06 21:21:27+00:00	
1076	2020-03-06 21:18:54+00:00	Thank you @GovBillLee. We are a phone call away, and here for you!
1077	2020-03-06 20:59:00+00:00	My Administration is with you all of the way, Tennessee. We love you!
1078	2020-03-06 15:47:58+00:00	Spoke to Governor @GavinNewsom early this morning about the cruise ship quarantined off the California Coast. CoronaVirus test kits have been delivered, testing is taking place now.
1079	2020-03-06 15:38:06+00:00	It is FAKE NEWS that @HHSGov @SecAzar is “sidelined” from the great job he is doing on the CoronaVirus Task Force. He has the total confidence of the @VP and myself, and is doing a fantastic job, as the numbers would indicate!
1080	2020-03-06 15:08:07+00:00	I will protect your Social Security and Medicare, just as I have for the past 3 years. Sleepy Joe Biden will destroy both in very short order, and he won’t even know he’s doing it!

1082	2020-03-06 14:21:18+00:00	JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!!!
1083	2020-03-06 05:21:26+00:00	Thanks Linda, but they were really good last night!
1084	2020-03-06 05:15:37+00:00	Thank you!
1085	2020-03-06 03:49:40+00:00	My great honor!
1086	2020-03-06 03:33:20+00:00	Thank you Audrey!
1087	2020-03-06 03:27:23+00:00	The WALL is well under construction. So far we’re up to 129 miles, and by early next year we will have 500 miles completed!
1088	2020-03-06 03:18:37+00:00	We have appointed 220 Federal Judges and two Supreme Court Justices. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT!
1089	2020-03-06 03:15:23+00:00	Thank you David, a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania. We will continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!
1090	2020-03-06 02:05:17+00:00	Thank you Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was a great evening!
1091	2020-03-06 01:59:14+00:00	Tonight’s Fox News Town Hall with @MarthaMacCallum and @BretBaier will rebroadcast at 11:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
1092	2020-03-05 20:38:22+00:00	Thank you Nan!
1093	2020-03-05 20:34:49+00:00	Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation. The April 2009-10 Swine Flu, where nearly 13,000 people died in the U.S., was poorly handled. Ask MSDNC & lightweight Washington failure @RonaldKlain, who the President was then?
1094	2020-03-05 19:02:39+00:00	The Department of Education is NOT closing hundreds of schools in rural areas of our Country. This is just more Fake News. We are investing greatly in our schools, and always will!
1095	2020-03-05 18:28:49+00:00	Mini Mike, you’re easy! https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/1235232463045177344
1096	2020-03-05 16:34:21+00:00	With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!
1097	2020-03-05 16:22:04+00:00	“Joe Biden represents the past. President Trump represents the future.” @LisaMarieBoothe @edhenry @FoxNews
1098	2020-03-05 16:10:49+00:00	Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike’s head, just dropped out of the Democrat Primary...THREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie, at least, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass.
1099	2020-03-05 16:02:43+00:00	.@GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy informed me that I was 20 for 20 on Tuesday with respect to my Endorsement of candidates. Sadly, I didn’t get that information from the Fake News Media. They don’t report those things, or the far more than Dems cumulative votes, despite no opposition!
1100	2020-03-05 15:53:33+00:00	“I want to commend the President for how he has handled the CoronaVirus situation, especially his early decision to shut down access into our Country from China, despite strong opposition to that decision.” @SenTomCotton Thank you Tom!
1101	2020-03-05 15:30:50+00:00	Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court!
1102	2020-03-05 14:30:50+00:00	I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible & successful effort being made!
1103	2020-03-05 14:11:25+00:00	As per recent Federal Court ruling, the Federal Government will be withholding funds from Sanctuary Cities. They should change their status and go non-Sanctuary. Do not protect criminals!

1106	2020-03-05 02:03:37+00:00	I will be interviewed by @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 9:10 P.M.
1107	2020-03-05 01:23:29+00:00	Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will receive the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week!
1108	2020-03-05 01:03:06+00:00	There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!
1109	2020-03-05 00:21:01+00:00	This is a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer. If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. Serious action MUST be taken NOW!
1110	2020-03-04 23:49:47+00:00	Thank you, keep up the great work!
1111	2020-03-04 23:46:50+00:00	Congress has agreed to provide $8 Billion to fight Coronavirus! This means @CDCgov, @HHSGov, and @DHSgov will have the resources they need to Keep America Safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low. This is great news for our Health, our Economy, and our Nation!
1112	2020-03-04 23:43:30+00:00	Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
1113	2020-03-04 20:06:11+00:00	Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, Tom Steyer, have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election! They both wish they had it to do over again!
1114	2020-03-04 19:30:11+00:00	Today, it was my great honor to address the @LatinoCoalition Legislative Summit. With the hard work, love &amp; devotion of millions of incredible Hispanic-Americans, our Country is thriving, our people are prospering, and our future has never looked brighter!
1115	2020-03-04 16:06:04+00:00	Mini Mike, “Three months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump, (and I failed miserably!).
1116	2020-03-04 15:57:08+00:00	Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O’Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS. This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his life...and now on to Sleepy Joe!
1117	2020-03-04 15:40:01+00:00	Mini Mike Bloomberg just “quit” the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign, hoping to save face. It won’t work!
1118	2020-03-04 15:32:30+00:00	The Mayor of Los Angeles, @ericgarcetti, is dealing with us trying to get the Federal Government to fix the terrible problem he and the Dems have caused with the homeless, and the horrendous effects it is having on the City, which is a mess. I then watch him talk “trash” on me!
1119	2020-03-04 15:21:44+00:00	Wow! If Elizabeth Warren wasn’t in the race, Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas, not to mention various other states. Our modern day Pocahontas won’t go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!
1120	2020-03-04 14:56:01+00:00	The great people of Montana can have no better VOICE than Senator @SteveDaines. He is doing an incredible job! Whoever the Democrat nominee may be, please understand that I will be working hard with Steve all the way, &amp; last night I was 20 for 20 (per @GOPLeader). WE NEED STEVE!
1121	2020-03-04 14:20:44+00:00	I will be going to the Great State of Tennessee on Friday. The USA stands with the people of Tennessee 100%, whatever they need! The tornadoes were of record size & velocity. God bless your loved ones & all of the families affected! Thanks to @GovBillLee &amp; @MarshaBlackburn
1122	2020-03-04 12:48:23+00:00	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!
1123	2020-03-04 12:31:24+00:00	This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!
1124	2020-03-04 12:12:29+00:00	So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldn’t!
1125	2020-03-04 11:52:25+00:00	The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for Joe!

1129	2020-03-04 03:35:16+00:00	Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, other than Mini Mike, was the loser of the night. She didn’t even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts. Well, now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!
1130	2020-03-04 03:23:58+00:00	The biggest loser tonight, by far, is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His “political” consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!

When I sign it into law, it will be HISTORIC for our beautiful public lands. ALL thanks to @SenCoryGardner and @SteveDaines, two GREAT Conservative Leaders!
1144	2020-03-03 18:30:37+00:00	I commend the hard work of Senator @SteveDaines and @SenCoryGardner in protecting funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund for years to come. The citizens of Montana and Colorado thank you both!

1147	2020-03-03 15:51:43+00:00	The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!

1149	2020-03-03 14:30:27+00:00	Mini Mike Bloomberg can never recover from his incompetent debate performances. Also, as mayor he was very bad under pressure - a choker!

1153	2020-03-03 06:34:02+00:00	....paying higher rates than many others, when we should be paying less. Tough on our exporters and puts the USA at a competitive disadvantage. Must be the other way around. Should ease and cut rate big. Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve has called it wrong from day one. Sad!
1154	2020-03-03 06:34:02+00:00	Australia’s Central Bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for China’s Coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us....
1155	2020-03-03 04:41:26+00:00	Thank you @JackBrewerBSI. We’re with you all the way. The American people know what’s going on, they totally get it. Watch what happens in November 2020! Thank you for your continued support. Together, we are going to KEEP AMERICA GREAT! #BlackVoicesforTrump
1156	2020-03-03 04:23:55+00:00	WOW! Sleepy Joe doesn’t know where he is, or what he’s doing. Honestly, I don’t think he even knows what office he's running for!
1157	2020-03-03 04:17:15+00:00	The Democrats in the House should propose a very simple one year Payroll Tax cut. Great for the middle class, great for the USA!

1169	2020-03-02 17:01:23+00:00	The only people in favor of Mini Mike continuing with his hapless campaign are me and his political consultants, who are getting richer and richer by the day!
1170	2020-03-02 16:43:33+00:00	.@FoxNews is working hard pushing the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats. They want to be, unlike their competitors, @CNN &amp; MSDNC (Comcast), Fair &amp; Balanced. When will they ever learn. The Radical Left never even gave @FoxNews permission to partake in their low rated debates!
1171	2020-03-02 15:16:34+00:00	....competitive disadvantage. We should be leading, not following!
1172	2020-03-02 15:16:33+00:00	As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act. Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive. The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We don’t, putting us at a.....
1173	2020-03-02 14:19:23+00:00	Jack Welch, former Chairman and CEO of GE, a business legend, has died. There was no corporate leader like “neutron” Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife & family!
1174	2020-03-02 12:55:20+00:00	I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn’t have a clue! Now they are fear mongering. Be calm & vigilant!
1175	2020-03-02 12:42:49+00:00	“Ever since (Mini Mike) Bloomberg’s bad debate performances, his support has dropped.” @abcnews Dropped a lot. Only his highly paid consultants, who are laughing all the way to the bank, still support him...And by the way, he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!
1176	2020-03-02 12:26:23+00:00	I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure. Progress being made!

1180	2020-03-02 01:10:07+00:00	Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd is not at the top of his game! Thank you.
1181	2020-03-02 01:07:58+00:00	Sleepy Joe Biden also said that guns killed 150 million Americans last year, wants to win Georgia on Super Tuesday (not up), and got his speaking location wrong again!
1182	2020-03-02 00:56:40+00:00	Thank you!
1183	2020-03-02 00:54:07+00:00	Thank you. I love you too!
1184	2020-03-02 00:46:51+00:00	The Black community brilliantly turned their backs on Mini Mike because they know he is a pandering phony who never did right by them!
1185	2020-03-02 00:08:40+00:00	Mini Mike Bloomberg didn’t bring NYC back, as he said in his fake ad. It was @RudyGiuliani who brought NYC back and who also, with his endorsement, got Mini Mike elected (with barely a thank you). A boring mayor who the people couldn’t stand!
1186	2020-03-01 23:43:34+00:00	Pete Buttigieg is OUT. All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden. Great timing. This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play - NO NOMINATION, AGAIN!
1187	2020-03-01 21:13:29+00:00	People are disgusted and embarrassed by the Fake News Media, as headed by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @comcast &amp; MSDNC, @ABC, @CBSNews and more. They no longer believe what they see and read, and for good reason. Fake News is, indeed, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

1189	2020-03-01 20:17:46+00:00	A Poll in today’s New York Post says that 77% of “U.S. adults have confidence in their government’s ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One), compared to other health threats.” 64% for Zika, 58% for Ebola.

1192	2020-03-01 13:23:38+00:00	.....a very dark and lonely path! Your reputation will never be the same!
1193	2020-03-01 13:23:34+00:00	Mini Mike Bloomberg’s consultants and so-called “advisors”(how did that advice work out? Don’t ask!), are on the “gravy train” and all making a fortune for themselves pushing Mini hard, when they knew he never had what it takes. Don’t pay them anymore Mike, they led you down....
1194	2020-03-01 05:39:39+00:00	I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer, or Mini Mike Bloombeg, would contribute to the Democrat Party, even against me, after the way they have been treated - laughed at & mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!
1195	2020-03-01 05:30:08+00:00	Tom Steyer who, other than Mini Mike Bloomberg, spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history, quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!
1196	2020-03-01 04:49:32+00:00	Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!
1197	2020-03-01 04:45:36+00:00	Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders, and take the nomination away from him!
1198	2020-03-01 00:16:33+00:00	Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!
1199	2020-02-29 23:42:15+00:00	THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

1209	2020-02-29 03:00:18+00:00	A so-called reporter named @JohnJHarwood, who bombed so badly in the 2016 Presidential Debates that I thought he was going to be immediately fired (a Mini Mike type performance), is now with Fake News @CNN. A total loser!
1210	2020-02-29 02:43:24+00:00	I hope we can get Admiral @RonnyJackson4TX of Texas, who served our Country so well, into the runoff election in #TX13! Ronny is strong on Crime and Borders, GREAT for our Military and Vets, and will protect your #2A. Get out and vote for Ronny on Tuesday, March 3rd!

1213	2020-02-28 22:24:23+00:00	I am pleased to announce the nomination of @RepRatcliffe (Congressman John Ratcliffe) to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Would have completed process earlier, but John wanted to wait until after IG Report was finished. John is an outstanding man of great talent!

1216	2020-02-28 20:28:00+00:00	The Dems are working hard to take the prized nomination away from Bernie. Back room politics, which Bernie is not very good at. His people will not let it happen again!
1217	2020-02-28 20:25:06+00:00	Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were, perhaps, the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed “Stop & Frisk” after swearing by it for years, and even recently. He horribly overused it, & then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony!

1220	2020-02-28 15:24:01+00:00	Worst Polls, just like in 2016 when they were so far off the mark, are the @FoxNews Polls. Why doesn’t Fox finally get a competent Polling Company?
1221	2020-02-28 14:54:51+00:00	To the people of South Carolina, Tom Steyer is a joke, laughed at by everyone, a total incompetent. He made money in coal, now he “hates” coal. Did you see him fawning over Crazy Bernie? Has no chance, a loser for South Carolina, doesn’t deserve your vote!
1222	2020-02-28 14:46:31+00:00	Will be in the Great State of South Carolina tonight, 7:00 P.M., for a really BIG Rally. Best place to be is a Trump Rally. See you later!

This is BIG NEWS! Funds will be cut off immediately. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1224	2020-02-28 05:43:14+00:00	The Do Nothing Democrats were busy wasting time on the Immigration Hoax, & anything else they could do to make the Republican Party look bad, while I was busy calling early BORDER & FLIGHT closings, putting us way ahead in our battle with Coronavirus. Dems called it VERY wrong!
1225	2020-02-28 05:05:02+00:00	So, the Coronavirus, which started in China and spread to various countries throughout the world, but very slowly in the U.S. because President Trump closed our border, and ended flights, VERY EARLY, is now being blamed, by the Do Nothing Democrats, to be the fault of “Trump”.
1226	2020-02-28 04:37:43+00:00	So nice!

1228	2020-02-28 03:16:28+00:00	Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates, that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is, he was not true to himself, and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike!
1229	2020-02-28 02:39:20+00:00	Congratulations and thank you to our great Vice President & all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at CDC & all other agencies on the Coronavirus situation.

1244	2020-02-26 13:03:27+00:00	I will be having a News Conference at the White House, on this subject, today at 6:00 P.M. CDC representatives, and others, will be there. Thank you!
1245	2020-02-26 13:03:21+00:00	Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible. Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape! @CDCgov.....
1246	2020-02-26 11:39:45+00:00	Just landed. India was great, trip very successful. Heading to the White House. Meetings and calls scheduled today. @CDCgov, @SecAzar and all doing a great job with respect to Coronavirus! Briefing this afternoon.

1250	2020-02-26 06:47:58+00:00	An absolute disgrace!
1251	2020-02-26 02:34:31+00:00	52% in the new Rasmussen Poll. 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!
1252	2020-02-26 02:29:24+00:00	....Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let’s keep it that way!
1253	2020-02-26 02:29:21+00:00	CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world. It was opposed by the Dems, “too soon”, but turned out to be the correct decision. No matter how well we do, however, the.....
1254	2020-02-25 22:36:02+00:00	That is because they cover your favorite President relatively well. @CNN &amp; MSDNC are dying in the ratings!
1255	2020-02-25 22:00:07+00:00	No surprise!
1256	2020-02-25 20:52:55+00:00	True, but we are getting it all done!
1257	2020-02-25 20:43:33+00:00	A total miscarriage of justice!
1258	2020-02-25 20:01:29+00:00	There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of “Trump” and Stone. She was totally biased, as is the judge. Roger wasn’t even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!
1259	2020-02-25 14:02:15+00:00	Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is complaining, for publicity purposes only, that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn’t like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!
1260	2020-02-25 12:58:49+00:00	
1261	2020-02-25 04:09:20+00:00	....on all Trump, or Trump related, matters! While “elections have consequences”, I only ask for fairness, especially when it comes to decisions made by the United States Supreme Court!
1262	2020-02-25 04:09:20+00:00	“Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices of being biased in favor of Trump.” @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to “shame” some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a “faker”. Both should recuse themselves..
1263	2020-02-25 02:29:59+00:00	..It has been a scam right from the beginning with the illegally started Mueller Report, FISA, the leaking, lying & more. Schiff should not have access to Intelligence, he is a corrupt pol. “Amazing that they went to Bernie Sanders, but not to President Trump.” @marthamaccallum
1264	2020-02-25 02:29:58+00:00	“U.S. Intelligence official overstated assessment of Russian efforts to help Trump.” @FoxNews @GreggJarrett They supposedly told Crazy Bernie that Russia was looking at him, not me. This is all a big scam between Intel and the Democrats. They want Bernie OUT, &amp; hate “Trump”.

1268	2020-02-24 21:42:02+00:00	The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!

1274	2020-02-24 11:09:57+00:00	Our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words: “We the people.” That means that in America and India alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower, and fight for the citizens we proudly serve!

1280	2020-02-23 22:51:07+00:00	Crazy Bernie and the Democrats should see this. I have done far more for the African American community than any President. Secured funding for HBCUs, Criminal Justice Reform, Opportunity Zones, School Choice, Record Low Unemployment, and so much more. THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
1281	2020-02-23 21:19:28+00:00	Jeff Van Drew is a Courageous Leader that left the Do Nothing Democrats to better serve the Great people of New Jersey. HAPPY BIRTHDAY @CongressmanJVD!
1282	2020-02-23 18:45:26+00:00	Are any Democrat operatives, the DNC, or Crooked Hillary Clinton, blaming Russia, Russia, Russia for the Bernie Sanders win in Nevada. If so I suggest calling Bob Mueller & the 13 Angry Democrats to do a new Mueller Report, Democrat Edition. Bob will get to the bottom of it!
1283	2020-02-23 18:29:08+00:00	Somebody please tell incompetent (thanks for my high poll numbers) & corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media. Someday he will be caught, & that will be a very unpleasant experience!

1287	2020-02-23 00:17:24+00:00	“The Kremlin is reportedly backing Bernie Sanders bid to win the White House.” Jon Scott @FoxNews Why didn’t somebody tell me this?
1288	2020-02-22 23:55:36+00:00	Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden & the rest look weak, & no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential Debates. Congratulations Bernie, & don’t let them take it away from you!
1289	2020-02-22 22:30:10+00:00	Look so forward to being with my great friends in INDIA!

1292	2020-02-22 15:18:17+00:00	Democrats in the Great State of Nevada (Which, because of the Economy, Jobs, the Military & Vets, I will win in November), be careful of Russia, Russia, Russia. According to Corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff, they are pushing for Crazy Bernie Sanders to win. Vote!

1297	2020-02-22 03:43:56+00:00	....The reason for this is that the Do Nothing Democrats, using disinformation Hoax number 7, don’t want Bernie Sanders to get the Democrat Nomination, and they figure this would be very bad for his chances. It’s all rigged, again, against Crazy Bernie Sanders!
1298	2020-02-22 03:43:56+00:00	MSDNC (Comcast Slime), @CNN and others of the Fake Media, have now added Crazy Bernie to the list of Russian Sympathizers, along with @TulsiGabbard &amp; Jill Stein (of the Green Party), both agents of Russia, they say. But now they report President Putin wants Bernie (or me) to win.
1299	2020-02-21 22:26:10+00:00	Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, & every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy & enthusiasm. We are welcoming Americans of all parties & political persuasions to join our incredible movement to #MAGA!
1300	2020-02-21 22:15:18+00:00	THANK YOU Las Vegas, Nevada! I was delighted to be back in a state I love, with proud, hardworking PATRIOTS. With your help, this November, we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Democrats, and we are going to win Nevada in a landslide! #KAG2020

1303	2020-02-21 16:19:00+00:00	@SenateGOP Highest Trump Poll Numbers EVER! Thank you!

1307	2020-02-21 15:36:48+00:00	Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!

1312	2020-02-21 02:19:49+00:00	I was thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs tonight, beneath the majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains, with thousands of terrific, hardworking American Patriots. With your help, this November, we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Dems, and we are going to WIN Colorado!

Check the polls taken immediately after the debates. The debates got me elected. Must be Fox Board Member Paul Ryan!

1317	2020-02-20 18:24:04+00:00	“The real winner last night was Donald Trump.” Mini Mike Bloomberg. I agree!

1319	2020-02-20 17:13:42+00:00	“I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever of Senator Sanders defeating President Trump.” Mini Mike Bloomberg. Mini, there’s even less chance, especially after watching your debate performance last night, of you winning the Democrat nomination...But I hope you do!
1320	2020-02-20 15:29:18+00:00	John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran. If a Republican did what they did, there would be very serious ramifications!
1321	2020-02-20 15:22:15+00:00	“They say Roger Stone lied to Congress.” @CNN OH, I see, but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information, for which almost everyone, other than Crooked Hillary Clinton, goes to jail for a long time), and so did Andy McCabe, who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS?
1322	2020-02-20 13:35:20+00:00	A really great moment!
1323	2020-02-20 13:27:52+00:00	This is the REAL Mini Mike. He admitted, many times, that he is “a fan of Donald Trump. He’s a New York ICON.” Thank you Mike!
1324	2020-02-20 12:37:26+00:00	.@JRubinBlogger (Jennifer Rubin), the wacko “conservative” of the @washingtonpost, must learn how to spell the name Bloomberg before it is too late &amp; he is gone!

1326	2020-02-20 06:19:56+00:00	Mini Mike Bloomberg’s debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn’t knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!
1327	2020-02-20 06:18:24+00:00	Thank you Arizona! With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep ON WINNING! America is thriving like never before, and the BEST IS YET TO COME!

1342	2020-02-19 14:45:38+00:00	Kerry & Murphy illegally violated the Logan Act. This is why Iran is not making a deal. Must be dealt with strongly!

1362	2020-02-18 13:14:21+00:00	....badly tainted and, in my opinion, should be thrown out. Even Mueller’s statement to Congress that he did not see me to become the FBI Director (again), has been proven false. The whole deal was a total SCAM. If I wasn’t President, I’d be suing everyone all over the place...
1363	2020-02-18 13:14:20+00:00	These were Mueller prosecutors, and the whole Mueller investigation was illegally set up based on a phony and now fully discredited Fake Dossier, lying and forging documents to the FISA Court, and many other things. Everything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is...

1376	2020-02-16 17:11:48+00:00	Last week the Fake News said that a section of our powerful, under construction, Southern Border Wall “fell over”, trying to make it sound terrible, except the reason was that the concrete foundation was just poured & soaking wet when big winds kicked in. Quickly fixed “forever”.

1378	2020-02-15 22:40:44+00:00	Thank you to @JackBrewerBSI for your kind words on the great progress we have made on our powerful African-American Agenda. For one, lowest unemployment numbers in USA history. Many other great records! @foxandfriends @FoxNews

1381	2020-02-15 22:30:49+00:00	Years ago the Democrats had the money to build the Wall, but they didn’t have any idea how to get it done. I am building it bigger and better than ever thought possible!
