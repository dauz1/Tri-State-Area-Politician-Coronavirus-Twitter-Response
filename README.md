# Tri-State-Area-Politician-Coronavirus-Twitter-Response

The following files are Python code that gathers Tweet sentiment and LIWC data for each politician:

Tweet Sentiment (Cuomo).py

Tweet Sentiment (De Blasio).py

Tweet Sentiment (Lamont).py

Tweet Sentiment (Murphy).py

Tweet Sentiment (Trump).py


For each code to run, it must be saved in the same location as 'credentials.py', my personal Twitter API



The following Excel files are the resulting LIWC data per politician, sorted by raw count and percentage:

Cuomo LIWC.xlsx

De Blasio LIWC.xlsx

Lamont LIWC.xlsx

Murphy LIWC (version 1).xlsx

Trump LIWC.xlsx



The following Excel files are the Google Mobility Report data(I did not gather these numbers) for each politician's respective region:

ct_gmr.csv

nj_gmr.csv

ny_gmr.csv

nyc_gmr.csv

us_gmr.csv



The last two Word documents outline my findings on the weekly sentiment and LIWC for each politician:
