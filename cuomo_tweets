2	2020-05-24 16:27:15+00:00	Jones Beach is beautiful but it’s also a tremendous accomplishment. It was built on 7 miles of marsh. We did it then and that ambition is needed now. It’s not impossible.
3	2020-05-24 16:18:34+00:00	Together with the business community, we will think big and build back better. New York has always led the way. And we will do it here and now.

46	2020-05-19 16:19:35+00:00	Taxpayers shouldn’t subsidize corporate layoffs. It's 2008 all over again. I'm proposing that if a corporation gets gov't money, they MUST rehire the same #of employees they had pre-pandemic.
47	2020-05-19 16:13:19+00:00	Memorial Day is an important American tradition and we want to safely honor our veterans. The state will allow ceremonies with 10 people or less, at the discretion of local governments.

54	2020-05-18 16:15:45+00:00	New York State is ready and willing to partner with major sports teams that are interested in playing games safely, without fans. If our professional sports teams can make it work (& be safe) on their end, we’re supportive.
55	2020-05-18 15:57:13+00:00	The stakes are high, and expert, scientific opinion is far more valuable than political opinion. I’m pleased to announce that Dr. Michael Osterholm and Dr. Samir Bhatt, two international experts in epidemiology, will be advising NY on our progress and our metrics.
56	2020-05-18 15:51:34+00:00	Update: Judges and staff will be returning to courthouses in 30 Upstate counties starting this week.

58	2020-05-18 15:43:15+00:00	We must do all we can to protect the most vulnerable. NY has required all nursing home staff to be tested for COVID twice a week. To make sure that happens we are sending 320K testing kits to nursing homes statewide.
59	2020-05-18 15:38:42+00:00	New York responded to the COVID crisis with great unity and great discipline. We need that same discipline as regions begin to reopen.

64	2020-05-17 16:18:47+00:00	Testing is fast and easy, and there are over 700+ sites in New York where you can get a COVID test. Anyone with symptoms is eligible. So are essential workers. Find a testing site near you:
65	2020-05-17 16:16:37+00:00	We now have more testing capacity than New Yorkers are using. We need to use our full testing capacity as we reopen. If you have COVID symptoms or have been in contact with someone with COVID — get a test.
66	2020-05-17 16:14:50+00:00	New York has rapidly expanded our testing capacity. We have met our earlier target of 40,000 diagnostic tests daily. As a percentage of our population, NY has tested more than any other state.
67	2020-05-17 16:12:47+00:00	Up to 38% of Americans are experiencing mental distress. The Mental Health Coalition launched the #HowAreYouReally campaign to raise awareness about the mental health issues so many people are facing. We all need to look out for one another.
68	2020-05-17 16:09:56+00:00	The COVID-19 crisis is a mental health crisis, and it deserves far more attention than it's gotten. Don't underestimate the trauma this has created for people. NYers can call 1-844-863-9314 for emotional support.

73	2020-05-16 17:01:43+00:00	When we openly talk about mental health, we can better address it. I’m proud to stand with @kennethcolereal and the Mental Health Coalition and join the #howareyoureallychallenge. I nominate @GovMurphy — share how you are, really.
74	2020-05-16 16:06:39+00:00	To those trying to make COVID funding into a Red vs. Blue issue. To those counting how many people passed away by their political party. To those more interested in helping states where Republicans live than where Democrats live. Shame on you.
75	2020-05-16 15:48:12+00:00	The House passed a smart bill yesterday, the #HeroesAct, that funds states. Remember: It's the states who fund hospitals, schools, firefighters, police and crucial services that working Americans rely on. The Senate needs to act fast to pass it too.
76	2020-05-16 15:44:00+00:00	NEW: We will allow elective surgeries to resume in Westchester County and Suffolk County, including at Ambulatory Surgery Centers.
77	2020-05-16 15:41:19+00:00	As we phase reopening we are looking for all opportunities to reopen economic activity without crowds. For example, horse racing tracks across the state can open June 1 without fans.

81	2020-05-15 16:22:20+00:00	As part of Phase One of reopening, residential and commercial construction can resume in the regions that have met the benchmarks. -Indoor & outdoor work allowed -Masks must be worn within 6 feet of another worker -Employer must provide masks -No congregate meetings
82	2020-05-15 16:16:30+00:00	If you live in a region that's in Phase 1 of reopening, retail businesses can open for curbside pickup or in-store pickup (if curbside not practical). -Customers must order ahead -Social distancing required in store -Patrons & staff must wear masks in store -Sanitizer available
83	2020-05-15 16:03:33+00:00	What happens next is up to each of us. This virus is powerful and every time we think we understand it we learn we don’t. Government alone can’t keep you safe. It’s up to you.
84	2020-05-15 15:59:15+00:00	City, town and county beaches may open as well on Friday of Memorial Day weekend, as long as they fully enforce the minimum rules. They may impose additional conditions. If local government's don't enforce these rules, the beaches will be closed.
85	2020-05-15 15:52:16+00:00	As a region we have established a joint agreement on beaches in NY, NJ, CT and DE. State beaches will open Friday of Memorial Day weekend with strict precautions. Beaches will be at 50% capacity & masks will be required when social distance not possible. Staff will enforce.
86	2020-05-15 15:41:28+00:00	NY on PAUSE is extended to May 28 for regions that don't begin reopening today. But as soon as a region hits its benchmark, it comes online immediately — it does not have to wait until May 28.

90	2020-05-15 00:46:41+00:00	The Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley, the North Country, and Central NY are ready to begin Phase 1 of reopening tomorrow. The others can be UN-PAUSED the moment they hit their benchmarks. New Yorkers be proud. Your actions bent the curve.
91	2020-05-14 18:37:00+00:00	This is not just about what government does. It’s also about what New Yorkers do. If you wear a mask in public, if you wash your hands often, if you avoid large gatherings — you will be safer.
92	2020-05-14 18:27:59+00:00	Like New York State, 16 other states and 6 European countries have reported cases of children suffering from potentially COVID-related illnesses. NY is leading the way on research. We need to understand all we can as fast as we can when it comes to our children.
93	2020-05-14 18:25:36+00:00	New York State is working to build a strong medical manufacturing supply chain in our own state. We never again want to be in a position where we need to rely on foreign imports to get critical supplies like N95 masks. It’s a national security issue.
94	2020-05-14 18:15:44+00:00	NEW: Central New York has now met all seven metrics to begin Phase 1 of reopening on May 15th. It joins Mohawk Valley, Southern Tier, Finger Lakes, and the North Country.

101	2020-05-13 18:04:18+00:00	As of today, the North Country has met all seven metrics required to begin reopening May 15th. It joins the Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, and Mohawk Valley regions that have also met the requirements to begin reopening. See where your region stands:
102	2020-05-13 16:06:17+00:00	If a corporation gets a check from the government, they must rehire the same number of workers after the pandemic as employed before. Taxpayers shouldn’t subsidize companies that lay off workers.
103	2020-05-13 15:59:36+00:00	While we believe this illness to be rare, seek care is your child has these symptoms — especially if your child has been exposed to someone who had COVID-19.
104	2020-05-13 15:57:52+00:00	NYS is investigating 102 cases of a potentially COVID-related inflammatory illness in children. Tragically, 3 young NYers lost their lives to this illness. Though rare, we have cases in children of all ages. 14 other states and 5 European countries have also reported cases.
105	2020-05-13 15:47:51+00:00	Our decisions are based on science. Watch the measures. Watch the numbers. But the rate of transmission is based on the actions of all of us. You tell me what New Yorkers do today, and I'll tell you what the transmission rate will be tomorrow.
106	2020-05-13 15:43:51+00:00	Our reopening process is totally transparent and based on data. You can see for yourself exactly what is happening in your region on a daily basis. Visit the Regional Monitoring Dashboard: https://forward.ny.gov/regional-monitoring-dashboard

111	2020-05-13 13:29:14+00:00	Washington’s bailout rule should be simple and clear: No government support if you don’t hire back all of your pre-pandemic workers.
112	2020-05-13 13:09:40+00:00	Price gouging on products that protect people from Coronavirus is dishonest. It’s also illegal. New York State has referred over 2,000 gouging complaints to law enforcement. To report suspected price gouging, call 800-697-1220.
113	2020-05-12 22:33:24+00:00	"An LC-130 ""Skibird"" from the New York Air National Guard flew over Albany today to salute first responders and essential workers fighting on the frontlines against this virus."

116	2020-05-12 18:08:13+00:00	I'm proposing the Americans First Law: If a corporation does not rehire the same number of employees, they must return any COVID funds received.
117	2020-05-12 17:57:59+00:00	The federal government bailed out big corporations and gave millionaires a tax cut in the first COVID bills. It’s time for them to fund: -State and local governments -Testing and tracing programs -A real economic stimulus that helps working Americans
118	2020-05-12 17:50:12+00:00	When we begin to reopen we will do so on a regional basis and in a controlled, safe way. All information by region is clear and available to the public. We want all New Yorkers to have the facts. https://forward.ny.gov/regional-monitoring-dashboard

126	2020-05-11 18:19:59+00:00	Jerry Stiller was as New York as they come. To my friend Ben who, like his father, is a New Yorker through and through I extend my deepest condolences. Jerry will be missed.
127	2020-05-11 16:24:48+00:00	What New Yorkers have done, nobody could have imagined. The people accomplished a great feat in flattening the curve. We need New Yorkers to show that same resolve and intelligence in this next phase.
128	2020-05-11 16:03:51+00:00	New York will reopen statewide certain low-risk businesses and recreational activities as of May 15. These include: -Landscaping and gardening -Outdoor, low-risk recreational activities like tennis -Drive-in movie theaters

137	2020-05-10 16:30:17+00:00	Congress needs to fund working Americans. They've funded corporations, airlines and banks. They literally put a tax break for millionaires into their COVID legislation. Don’t make the same mistake twice. Fund working Americans.
138	2020-05-10 16:22:14+00:00	.@HealthNYGov is now investigating up to 85 cases of what may be a COVID-related illness in children. Symptoms are similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Though the illness is rare, we ask parents to be vigilant. Learn more:

147	2020-05-09 16:03:07+00:00	Communities of color have been disproportionately & unfairly impacted by this pandemic. This partnership will help us tackle these inequities. Thank you to @RepJeffries @NydiaVelazquez @RepYvetteClarke and our many partners in the faith community for making this possible.
148	2020-05-09 15:57:44+00:00	NEW: New York is partnering with @NorthwellHealth to open 24 temporary COVID testing sites at churches in predominantly low-income communities &amp; communities of color. We must address the racial disparities of this pandemic, and meet the need where it is.

150	2020-05-09 15:47:11+00:00	Tragically, three young New Yorkers have died of what may be a COVID-related illness in children. This illness has symptoms that are similar to Kawasaki disease & toxic shock syndrome. DOH is investigating & we will provide updates. Though rare, we urge parents to be vigilant.

160	2020-05-08 17:29:18+00:00	COVID-19 will not stand in the way of justice. We will extend the window for victims to file cases under the #ChildVictimsAct an additional five months. Victims will now have until January 14 to file cases under this law.
161	2020-05-08 16:31:44+00:00	Parents — seek care immediately if your child has these symptoms:
162	2020-05-08 16:27:57+00:00	I will continue to give New Yorkers the facts, whether the facts are pretty or ugly. Every one of us, through our actions, will shape the course of this pandemic. That’s why it’s so important to know the facts and stay informed.
163	2020-05-08 16:18:04+00:00	There have been 73 reported cases in NY of children getting severely ill with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome.

We launched a program to buy excess agricultural products and donate them to food banks. We will bring products from 2,100 Upstate farms to 50 food banks, providing 20,000 households with food.
176	2020-05-07 15:52:40+00:00	Today we are banning late fees and missed payments fees during the eviction moratorium period. We are also allowing renters facing COVID-related hardship to use their security deposit as payment and repay the deposit over time.

209	2020-05-04 16:14:06+00:00	Some regions of New York are closer to reopening than others. Currently, no region meets all the requirements necessary to reopen safely and securely. There is a lot of work to do.
210	2020-05-04 16:12:46+00:00	It's disrespectful to our frontline workers –⁠ and to your neighbors –⁠ not to wear a mask in public when you can't socially distance. Why? Because you don't wear a mask to protect yourself. You wear one to protect others.
211	2020-05-04 16:00:35+00:00	1 million New Yorkers have now been tested for COVID-19. NY is doing more diagnostic tests per capita than any other state — and any other nation. We are working tirelessly to increase testing capacity even more.

247	2020-04-30 16:14:17+00:00	This is an extraordinary effort and requires us all to work together. This will be a joint MTA/State/City partnership. I thank @NYCMayor for helping meet this challenge alongside us.
248	2020-04-30 16:09:06+00:00	I asked the MTA to develop a plan to accomplish this. They will do it by stopping MTA train service between 1am - 5am. There will be alternative transportation during this time with buses, for-hire vehicles, at NO cost to essential workers.
249	2020-04-30 16:04:01+00:00	It is our obligation to do everything we can to keep our essential workers safe. The MTA stepped up to clean trains and buses every 72 hours (a massive undertaking). Now, we must clean and disinfect every 24 hours. This is unprecedented, but we must do it.
250	2020-04-30 15:58:17+00:00	.@JohnsHopkins will develop a world-class online curriculum with a training program &amp; online exam. To qualify as a tracer you must pass the exam. We will create a comprehensive playbook for contact tracing that will be available as a resource for any state or city in need.
251	2020-04-30 15:53:20+00:00	We make decisions based on data. We have the playbook: Test — Trace — Isolate. We are building an army of tracers. @MikeBloomberg &amp; @JohnsHopkins are leading the recruitment and training of the tracers, in consultation with the State DOH. We can meet this challenge.

255	2020-04-30 12:39:00+00:00	Politicians should try to be half as good as the American people.
256	2020-04-29 23:20:17+00:00	There are no words to show enough love to our essential workers — so we say it simply — Good Job.
257	2020-04-29 22:46:59+00:00	I just signed an Executive Order which: -Diversifies birthing site options to support patient choice -Extends the time period that a healthy partner can accompany a mother post-delivery -Clarifies that doulas are essential support and allowed during labor & delivery
258	2020-04-29 22:46:59+00:00	We know many pregnant women are struggling with additional stress & anxiety during this pandemic. I adopted the recommendations of the COVID-19 Maternity Task Force, led by @melissadderosa, to try to address any additional pain points for expectant mothers.
259	2020-04-29 18:01:33+00:00	Thousands of masks have been sent to New York from around the country — made with love. This is a self-portrait of the goodness of Americans. Thank you. (And for those wondering, yes, we will find good homes for the masks.)
260	2020-04-29 17:46:03+00:00	During tonight’s 7pm clap, join us to say Good Job to our heroes — the essential workers who make NYS run day in and day out.
261	2020-04-29 17:06:01+00:00	The fashion industry and the workers who make it run are a beautiful part of NY. The @CFDA &amp; @voguemagazine launched an initiative to support low income fashion industry workers during this time of crisis. Thank you to everyone who has supported.
262	2020-04-29 16:31:03+00:00	NY has received hundreds of donated masks from all around the country, from red states and blue states. They were sent because Americans are unified and generous and kind. Our politicians should aspire to be at least half as good as the American people.
263	2020-04-29 16:12:11+00:00	When it comes to funding corporate America, no amount is too high. When it comes to funding working Americans, the purse strings are closed tight. I say that’s WRONG. Let's fund working Americans.
264	2020-04-29 16:06:43+00:00	Let's talk about priorities. Sen. McConnell cares about bailing out: -Airlines -Big corporations -Hotels -Restaurant chains -Public companies State and local governments want $to fund: -Police -Firefighters -Nurses -Food banks -Social services -Teachers
265	2020-04-29 16:03:06+00:00	Reminder: -NYS pays $29B more to the fed gov't than it gets back every year. -Kentucky TAKES $37B more than they pay. -Florida TAKES $30 billion more than they pay. Facts Matter.
266	2020-04-29 16:03:06+00:00	Mitch McConnell and his partisan brigade are dividing our country. Their not-so-subtle message is: The states with more COVID cases don't deserve help from the states with fewer cases b/c they are Democrats. This is ugly and reprehensible — it's also wrong on the facts.
267	2020-04-29 15:47:54+00:00	New York State has tested over 2,000 first responders for COVID-19 antibodies. Preliminary results: FDNY/EMT: 17.1% positive NYPD: 10.5% positive
268	2020-04-29 15:43:52+00:00	We must make reopening decisions based on fact. No politics. No spin. No emotion. No conspiracies. Just the facts and the data and the science.

274	2020-04-28 16:33:26+00:00	We have studied reopening plans around the world and spoken to global health experts. We’ve come up with factual, data-driven principles to guide us on reopening. We will approach this on a regional basis. It’s the only smart thing to do.

278	2020-04-28 14:32:07+00:00	Today is #WorkersMemorialDay, a day that honors all workers who perished or died on the job. It is especially poignant this year, when we have tragically lost many essential workers to COVID-19. We mourn the heroes we've lost.
279	2020-04-28 13:41:18+00:00	I will be giving my daily #Coronavirus briefing at 11:30AM ET. Watch here: http://ny.gov
280	2020-04-27 18:01:36+00:00	NYS will provide $25 million for food banks and providers most impacted by COVID-19. We are also calling on philanthropies that would like to help the state’s food banks to email COVIDPhilanthropies@exec.ny.gov.
281	2020-04-27 16:15:57+00:00	This has been a hellish experience for our country. But it has also been a time of cooperation, unity and love. It’s not red state versus blue state. It’s us together versus this virus.
282	2020-04-27 15:58:28+00:00	At a time when there are hungry New Yorkers, milk shouldn’t be dumped. We are partnering with NYS dairy producers to use the excess milk to make yogurt and cheese that will be distributed to food banks & those in need.
283	2020-04-27 15:52:12+00:00	We are taking a regional approach to safely reopening NYS. Each region is facing its own set of facts. Protecting public health comes first and all decisions will be data-driven.
284	2020-04-27 15:39:36+00:00	NEW: Preliminary results from our statewide antibody survey suggest that 14.9% of the state is positive for the COVID-19 antibody. These results are drawn from an expanded sample size of about 7,500.

290	2020-04-26 17:01:09+00:00	Everyone has to think outside the box — because there is no box.
291	2020-04-26 16:40:48+00:00	As we look forward there will be multiple levels of decisions. Government will set the criteria for a phased reopening. Businesses will reimagine their workplaces & protocols. Individuals will make decisions on their own health. We will build back better.
292	2020-04-26 16:34:15+00:00	The COVID-19 rate of transmission (Rt) in NYS is now about 0.8. That means 10 positive people infect about 8 others. We must keep the Rt below 1 to keep slowing the spread.
293	2020-04-26 16:10:34+00:00	From day one we have made it our mission to give people the facts. When the public has the facts, they do the right thing. That's a lesson I hope people remember after this is all over.

297	2020-04-25 16:08:40+00:00	I will sign an Executive Order allowing independent pharmacists to conduct diagnostic Coronavirus tests. This will unlock a network of over 5,000 pharmacies as COVID-19 testing locations. Social distancing measures still apply. This will help us meet new lab capacity.
298	2020-04-25 15:57:49+00:00	What New Yorkers are doing is actually saving lives. It’s no exaggeration. I know the last weeks haven’t been easy — but the sacrifices New Yorkers are making are NOT in vain.
299	2020-04-25 15:53:25+00:00	NEW: Today we are conducting antibody testing for frontline healthcare workers at 4 NYC hospitals: -Bellevue Hospital -Elmhurst Hospital -Montefiore -SUNY Downstate Health Sciences Next week we will conduct antibody testing for MTA/transit workers, NYPD and State Police.
300	2020-04-25 15:49:59+00:00	We are expanding our diagnostic testing criteria so that first responders, frontline healthcare workers and essential workers can all be tested. They are our heroes who are risking their health to get us through this crisis. They deserve priority for testing.
301	2020-04-25 15:45:12+00:00	We have been through hell and it's not over yet. Yesterday we had ~1,100 people enter the hospital with COVID, which is more than we’d like but less than we have seen in 21 days. Our efforts are working. But we must keep it up if we want the curve to decline faster.

307	2020-04-24 22:42:26+00:00	No New Yorker should have to choose between their health and their right to vote. I am issuing an Executive Order mandating that the State Board of Elections automatically mail all registered voters postage-paid applications for an absentee ballot.
308	2020-04-24 20:35:37+00:00	NY has given $116 billion more to the federal government than we received since 2015. Kentucky *took* $148 billion more from the federal government than it gave. Just give NY our money back, Senator McConnell.
309	2020-04-24 19:55:33+00:00	Unfortunately, many victims who are isolated with their abuser may not be able to safely call the DV hotline out of risk of being overheard. We want you to know: You are not alone and you are not trapped because of COVID. We will help you get safe shelter. Text 844-997-2121.
310	2020-04-24 19:55:33+00:00	Amid an uptick in domestic violence incidents, NYS just launched a new 24/7 texting program & confidential online service. Abuse victims are often closely surveilled by their abuser, making these tools needed. Text 844-997-2121 or visit http://www.opdv.ny.gov if you need help.
311	2020-04-24 16:57:20+00:00	I received this letter from a farmer in northeast Kansas. His wife is ill and he is aging. He sent me 1 of 5 N95 masks he has from farming to pass on to a doctor or nurse in New York. This is humanity at its best. I share his letter as inspiration.
312	2020-04-24 16:09:45+00:00	Who gets told to “go bankrupt”: -“Blue” states -The firefighters, police, schools and healthcare workers that we fund Who doesn’t get told to “go bankrupt”: -Large corporations -Oil companies -Chain restaurants -Airlines
313	2020-04-24 15:42:38+00:00	For all we know it's only halftime. How fast the infection goes down depends on what we do now. If we rush back to business as usual the virus will spike fast and furious. We have to be smart.

The values observed during #Ramadan resonate with all New Yorkers, especially now: generosity, gratitude and brotherhood. To all who observe, I wish you a blessed Ramadan. Peace be unto you.
320	2020-04-23 18:47:00+00:00	My job is to give New Yorkers the facts — whether they're pretty or ugly. I believe that when New Yorkers have the facts, they act prudently.
321	2020-04-23 16:22:01+00:00	Let’s talk about fairness, Mitch. NYS puts $116 billion more into the federal pot than we take out. Kentucky TAKES $148 billion more from the federal pot than they put in. But we don't deserve help now because the 15,000 people who died here were predominately democrats?
322	2020-04-23 16:13:51+00:00	"One of the really dumb ideas of all time just came from Sen. Mitch McConnell. His suggestion to let states go bankrupt makes no sense. He says he doesn't want a ""Blue State Bailout."" 15,000 people died — this is not the time for politics."
323	2020-04-23 16:04:06+00:00	Percent positive by demographic: Female: 12% Male: 15.9% Asian: 11.7% Black: 22.1% Latino/Hispanic: 22.5% Multi/None/Other: 22.8% White: 9.1% (Weighted results)

325	2020-04-23 15:59:37+00:00	NEW: The first phase of results from a statewide antibody study are in. We collected approximately 3,000 antibody samples from 40 locations in 19 counties. Preliminary estimates show a 13.9% infection rate.
326	2020-04-23 15:51:54+00:00	Nursing homes are our top priority, and we will investigate any nursing home that violates the law. By law, nursing homes must: -Have adequate PPE -Isolate COVID residents -Temp checks for staff -Separate staff for COVID residents -Notify residents/family members of positives

332	2020-04-22 16:05:02+00:00	People will die if we get cocky about reopening. To those who are upset about our careful approach — don't blame your local official. Blame me.
333	2020-04-22 15:57:34+00:00	NEW: New York will launch a testing/tracing program in unison with CT and NJ. Mayor @MikeBloomberg has volunteered to help us develop the program. I thank him for taking this on with us — it will be expensive, challenging &amp; require an army of tracers. But it must be done.
334	2020-04-22 15:42:53+00:00	This is a profound moment in history. Our actions shape our future. If we get reckless today, we’ll suffer the consequences tomorrow.

340	2020-04-21 23:53:23+00:00	The President and I also discussed much-needed funding for the states. We immediately need federal funding to fill the hole COVID has put NYS in. The White House team understood our need.
341	2020-04-21 23:38:10+00:00	We plan to double our testing capacity from 20,000 tests per day to 40,000 per day. It is an ambitious goal but it is critical that we ramp up testing. #NewYorkTough
342	2020-04-21 23:31:46+00:00	I had a productive meeting with President Trump today. We agreed that the state will be responsible for managing the actual tests in our laboratories. The federal government will take on the responsibility of supply chain issues that are beyond states' control.

346	2020-04-21 15:16:07+00:00	We will make reopening decisions in New York State on a regional basis. We recognize not all regions are impacted with COVID-19 in the same way. It's the logical thing to do.
347	2020-04-21 15:12:01+00:00	Up until now testing was a private sector function. We never needed testing capacity on the scale we do now. Each state must be in charge of the labs in their state. The federal government must assist with international supply chain problems.
348	2020-04-21 15:08:52+00:00	NEW: We will allow elective outpatient treatment in counties & hospitals without significant risk of COVID-19 surge in the near future. This strategy will preserve beds for COVID patients. Excludes NYC and Erie, Albany, Dutchess, Westchester, Rockland, Suffolk & Nassau County.
349	2020-04-21 15:03:39+00:00	The State of New York is large and made up of very different regions. Each region is experiencing unique timing with the curve of this virus. We have to think regionally — and act based on the facts on the ground.

354	2020-04-20 22:26:03+00:00	This #YomHashoah we solemnly remember the six million Jewish men, women and children killed in the Holocaust. We stand in solidarity with the Jewish community, in New York and around the world, and pledge #NeverAgain.
355	2020-04-20 16:12:16+00:00	We are going through hell. When this is all over, I want people to say, we went through hell but we learned lessons and we built a better society because of it.
356	2020-04-20 16:09:01+00:00	Thank you to the women who make up 77% of frontline healthcare workers in the US. Many of us owe our lives to the heroic work being done by millions of women. They define #NewYorkTough.
357	2020-04-20 16:01:40+00:00	NYS is launching a new partnership to expand healthcare services and diagnostic testing to public housing residents in NYC. We MUST meet the need where it is highest. #NewYorkTough
358	2020-04-20 15:59:26+00:00	NEW: NYS will deliver more than 500,000 cloth masks to public housing communities — at least one for every resident. We will deliver 10,000 gallons of hand sanitizer to public housing communities. These communities are especially vulnerable.
359	2020-04-20 15:56:48+00:00	Our frontline workers deserve hazard pay. They deserve a 50% bonus. They are carrying us on their backs through this crisis. People of color disproportionality make up the brave frontline.
360	2020-04-20 15:53:00+00:00	We have our eye clearly on the ball here — the infection rate. It's the single indicator of risk and spread. As we make decisions it is the gauge I will be watching.

364	2020-04-19 23:06:33+00:00	Sunday dinner Cuomo style.
365	2020-04-19 22:35:00+00:00	Thank you to the 1.1 million frontline healthcare workers. Our gratitude is boundless. Thank you to the 445,000 hospital workers in our state. Thank you to the 160,000 nursing home workers. You are heroes. #NewYorkTough
366	2020-04-19 21:42:44+00:00	“Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” —Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan
367	2020-04-19 18:16:05+00:00	Government matters today in a way that it hasn’t mattered in decades. People need confidence in government. We commit to giving you the facts and looking for the answers.
368	2020-04-19 17:00:38+00:00	Think about what we’ve gone through. Think about how many New Yorkers we've lost and are still losing. We must tread VERY carefully now. The worst thing that can happen is for us to go through this hell all over again.
369	2020-04-19 16:33:58+00:00	We have slowed the infection rate so that every 10 people infect about 9 people. That means that the outbreak is slowing, not growing. But it leaves very little room for error. We need the bring the infection rate down even more in order to safely reopen the economy.
370	2020-04-19 16:29:47+00:00	NEW: NYS will undertake the most aggressive statewide antibody testing survey in the nation in the next week. It will tell us for the first time what percentage of the population has actually had #Coronavirus. This will be the first true snapshot of what we’re dealing with.
371	2020-04-19 16:21:13+00:00	We believe NY is past the peak and we are now descending the other side of the mountain. The continuation of this positive trend depends on our actions. What each of us does makes all the difference.

374	2020-04-19 15:33:08+00:00	I will be giving my daily briefing at 12 PM ET from Northwell Health in Long Island. Watch at http://ny.gov
375	2020-04-19 13:49:23+00:00	The curve may be flattening but we can’t stop what we’re doing now. Social distancing saves lives. Stay Home. Stop the Spread. Save Lives.
376	2020-04-18 20:41:01+00:00	This crisis has shown that government matters. Expertise matters. Science matters. @CGIU
377	2020-04-18 17:55:23+00:00	NEW: I am issuing an Executive Order allowing New Yorkers to obtain a marriage license remotely and allowing clerks to perform ceremonies via video conference.
378	2020-04-18 15:57:12+00:00	"""A house divided against itself cannot stand."" —Abraham Lincoln"
379	2020-04-18 15:54:40+00:00	We asked the top 50 labs in NYS what they would need to double their testing. They all said the same thing: They need more chemical reagents. We need the federal government to oversee the supply chain and help get labs what they need.
380	2020-04-18 15:51:15+00:00	Why is testing so important? -Testing is how you monitor the rate of infection. -Testing is how we find people with the virus and trace their contacts. The challenge is to bring testing up to scale.
381	2020-04-18 15:44:49+00:00	Remember: We still have about 2,000 new COVID hospitalizations daily. And we lost 540 New Yorkers yesterday. That is a soul-crushing loss. When you feel tired of social distancing, think of those we lost. That's what's at stake here.
382	2020-04-18 15:40:13+00:00	Hospitalization numbers are down. Emergency rooms are less crowded. Intubations are down. That’s because of what we have ALL done to flatten the curve. But it's not over yet. We must keep doing what we're doing.

387	2020-04-17 15:53:40+00:00	NEW: I'm issuing an Executive Order directing all public and private labs in NY to coordinate with the State Department of Health to ensure prioritizing diagnostic testing for public health and restarting the economy.
388	2020-04-17 15:50:27+00:00	Large-scale testing is a massive undertaking. We need the private sector to work with government to meet this enormous challenge. And we need the federal government to act.
389	2020-04-17 15:38:02+00:00	"New York is still seeing about 2,000 COVID hospitalizations per day. If people tell you the pandemic is ""over"" — they're wrong."

393	2020-04-16 18:43:28+00:00	New York will send 100 ventilators to our friends in New Jersey. Other states helped us when we most needed it, and we are proud to do the same. We're all in this together.
394	2020-04-16 16:29:47+00:00	I know this is hard. I wish I could say this will be over soon, but I can’t. We must make decisions based on the science and the data. Human lives are at stake.
395	2020-04-16 16:10:55+00:00	The policies and rules we have put in place are challenging and hard. But I trust New Yorkers. Social distancing works and it's thanks to all of you. I know that New Yorkers will do the right thing because we are #NewYorkTough.
396	2020-04-16 16:07:08+00:00	You MUST wear a face covering or mask: -On public transportation -In for-hire vehicles If you are a bus/train operator or a driver of a for-hire vehicle, you must also wear a face covering or mask. These rules go into effect on Friday at 8PM.
397	2020-04-16 16:03:42+00:00	New York on PAUSE will be extended in coordination with other states to May 15. Non-essential workers must continue to stay home. Social distancing rules remain in place. We must STAY THE COURSE.
398	2020-04-16 15:59:03+00:00	The workplace must be reimagined. Employers will need to develop new practices around workplace social distancing rules, transportation, customer interactions, and more. We need proactive protocols in the event of an infection at a workplace.
399	2020-04-16 15:57:29+00:00	There will be a phased return to a new normal. Business will reopen on a phased priority scale. Business will reopen based on the risk posed. We will work on a regional basis.
400	2020-04-16 15:55:11+00:00	Our strategy for reopening New York and bringing people out of their home at the appropriate time: 1) Do no harm: Control the rate of infection 2) Surge/flex: Strengthen the healthcare system 3) Test/trace: Need federal partnership 4) Phased return — not all at once

403	2020-04-16 13:09:02+00:00	Starting tomorrow, all New Yorkers MUST wear a cloth face covering or a mask when out in public and in situations where social distancing cannot be maintained.
404	2020-04-16 13:03:23+00:00	I will be giving my daily #Coronavirus briefing at 11:30AM ET. Watch here: http://ny.gov
405	2020-04-16 00:36:43+00:00	We are partnering with the NYS Court System to provide pro bono legal assistance to help people with issues resulting from the #Coronavirus pandemic. We need more volunteers. Lawyers interested in volunteering can sign up here:
406	2020-04-15 19:52:57+00:00	I have faith in New Yorkers. We do what makes sense. And it makes sense to cover your face to protect others. I believe in us. #NewYorkTough
407	2020-04-15 17:27:18+00:00	For example, if you are riding on public transit where it is impossible to maintain social distancing, or walking on a busy sidewalk, you must wear a face covering like a bandana or a mask.
408	2020-04-15 17:19:29+00:00	In our hour of need, other states stepped up to help us. We promised we would do the same. We will be sending 100 ventilators to Michigan and 50 ventilators to Maryland.
409	2020-04-15 17:17:28+00:00	As we look ahead, we will operate under one principle: Do No Harm. The gradually phased reopening will be determined by (1) how essential an industry is and (2) what the infection risk is for each industry. The most essential and lowest risk industries will be opened first.
410	2020-04-15 17:14:34+00:00	#BREAKING: I am issuing an Executive Order today that all people MUST wear a mask or face covering in public in situations where social distancing is not possible.
411	2020-04-15 17:05:19+00:00	In addition to testing, we need to trace contacts. We need an ARMY of tracers. To build tracing capacity we need federal funding.
412	2020-04-15 17:02:13+00:00	The states cannot compete with each other for testing supplies. Private companies are telling us they don’t have the equipment or chemicals or lab space to scale the number of tests. We need the federal government to partner in this.
413	2020-04-15 16:59:54+00:00	New York State will prioritize antibody testing for healthcare workers, first responders and essential workers.
414	2020-04-15 16:56:18+00:00	The single best tool to begin to safely reopen society is large-scaling testing. The unvarnished truth is that we can’t yet test to scale. And we can't get either diagnostic or antibody testing to scale without federal support.
415	2020-04-15 16:47:39+00:00	We are not out of the woods yet. Coronavirus is still a monumental public health crisis and we are losing New Yorkers every day to this virus. Each New Yorker lost to COVID is a heartbreaking loss.

419	2020-04-14 16:24:37+00:00	We have learned facts that are helping to control the virus. What we have also learned it that we can’t hermetically seal society. We know more each day and will use that knowledge to inform every decision we make.
420	2020-04-14 16:14:32+00:00	The federal government could help states by scaling up testing. There cannot be competition among 50 states for the testing supplies we need — driving prices through the roof. We learned this lesson. We've seen this movie. Tests must be allocated by need.
421	2020-04-14 15:56:39+00:00	“State governments possess inherent advantages, which will ever give them an influence & ascendency over the Nat'l Gov & will forever preclude the possibility of federal encroachments. That their liberties can be subverted by the federal head is repugnant...” —Alexander Hamilton
422	2020-04-14 15:48:36+00:00	We lost 778 New Yorkers yesterday to this vicious virus. We mourn each of them. Remember: Our actions determine our destiny. We flattened the curve and we must keep it up.

429	2020-04-13 20:58:17+00:00	Thank you to @MassGovernor for joining our multi-state regional effort – along with NJ, CT, PA, DE, RI – to plan a safe &amp; coordinated reopening. When we work together, we're stronger.
430	2020-04-13 19:26:23+00:00	From day one of this crisis, we have been committed to getting out the facts and data. It takes a team to do so. Secretary to the Governor @melissadderosa is the definition of #NewYorkTough.
431	2020-04-13 18:16:16+00:00	This is new terrain for all of us. As we make life-saving decisions there is strength in unity. Thank you for coordinating with us @GovMurphy, @GovNedLamont, @GovernorTomWolf, @JohnCarneyDE and @GovRaimondo.

435	2020-04-13 15:56:51+00:00	Any plan to reopen society MUST be driven by data and experts, not opinion and politics. We will learn from the warning signs from other countries. We will take every precaution. We will work together as a region.
436	2020-04-13 15:49:42+00:00	We are in a situation that never has occurred before. Reopening the economy is a delicate balance. The objective is to ease isolation & increase economic activity without increasing the infection rate. We must do it slowly & intelligently & with every precaution.
437	2020-04-13 15:39:09+00:00	New York mourns the 671 people we lost yesterday. We lost them on Easter Sunday. And that acute pain is deeply felt by all of us.

442	2020-04-12 15:57:57+00:00	NEW: I am signing an Executive Order directing employers to provide essential workers with cloth or surgical face masks to wear when directly interacting with the public. We will safeguard the public health by having those who interact with public wear appropriate face coverings
443	2020-04-12 15:46:29+00:00	Some states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case. New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case. We need a fair federal stimulus bill that is distributed by need.
444	2020-04-12 15:43:06+00:00	We deeply mourn the 758 New Yorkers we lost yesterday to COVID-19. New York is not numb. We know this is not just a number — it is real lives lost forever.

449	2020-04-12 12:30:45+00:00	From my family to yours, #HappyEaster. While this year’s celebrations will be different, I hope that this holy day will bring a sense of joy, renewal and promise to all who celebrate.
450	2020-04-11 23:26:44+00:00	We know it is challenging but for those celebrating, #Easter in-person celebrations must be held with only immediate family members to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These are difficult times, but we stay apart to save lives.
451	2020-04-11 20:09:04+00:00	Thank you to the essential workers who show up every day. You are truly amazing, outstanding human beings, and all of New York is grateful to you. #HealthcareHeroes
452	2020-04-11 15:55:55+00:00	I know we all want things to go back to normal. But the worst thing that can happen is that we make a misstep and we let our emotions get ahead of logic and facts, and we go through this all over again.
453	2020-04-11 15:53:13+00:00	What do we do now? -More and faster testing -Be better prepared -Federal stimulus When and how we reopen is both a public health and economic question. We must avoid a second wave of infection.
454	2020-04-11 15:51:08+00:00	"We believe we have hit the ""apex"" — and the apex is a plateau. We are not out of the woods. We are still seeing new hospitalizations and new infections. But it is stabilizing. Social distancing is working. We must keep it up."
455	2020-04-11 15:43:08+00:00	We lost an additional 783 New Yorkers yesterday. These are staggering numbers. Behind this number are individuals and families, and untold loss and pain. We mourn all those who we lost to this vicious virus.

461	2020-04-10 15:59:57+00:00	Reopening NYS will be a gradual process and it all comes down to testing. We developed an antibody test but we need the Federal Government to help. They must use the Defense Production Act to rapidly scale up testing. If I could – I would.
462	2020-04-10 15:53:14+00:00	"Saying thanks is nice. Providing assistance is better. I’m working with NY's Congressional delegation to create a ""COVID-19 Heroes Compensation Fund"" to support frontline workers and their families. Just as Congress did after 9/11, we need to support our heroes once again."
463	2020-04-10 15:46:14+00:00	No one should go hungry because of this pandemic. NYS will provide $200 million in emergency food assistance to more than 700K low-income households enrolled in SNAP. Food is a very real issue for many families.
464	2020-04-10 15:43:47+00:00	We continue to endure great pain as we lost 777 New Yorkers yesterday. We feel this loss deeply as a state, community and New York family. It is a terrible, heartbreaking loss.
465	2020-04-10 15:38:50+00:00	We are cautiously optimistic that we are slowing the spread. The change in daily ICU admissions was a negative number for the first time (-17). That means there were fewer people in ICU units statewide yesterday than there were on the previous day.

474	2020-04-09 15:54:28+00:00	The 1918 Spanish flu hit in 3 waves. We are only in the first wave. We can’t assume that because we are seeing some positive signs this will be over soon or that additional waves won’t hit. NYS will not underestimate this enemy.
475	2020-04-09 15:49:10+00:00	We lost 799 New Yorkers yesterday to this invisible enemy. We mourn them and stand in support of their families and loved ones. There are no words that can express our grief and heartbreak. The lives lost to COVID are a loss to the very fabric of NY.
476	2020-04-09 15:44:20+00:00	Our healthcare system has done a phenomenal job increasing capacity and saving lives. Thanks to social distancing and NY on PAUSE we are flattening the curve. But we must remain vigilant. #NewYorkTough

483	2020-04-08 16:51:41+00:00	The best way to stop the spread of #COVID19 is to stay home. It will save lives. I want to protect my mother, Matilda. Tell us who you’re staying home for and post with the hashtags #NewYorkTough &amp; #IStayHomeFor and tag your friends. @JLo and @AROD who are you staying home for?
484	2020-04-08 16:50:54+00:00	#BREAKING: All New Yorkers will be able to vote absentee on the June 23rd primaries. New Yorkers shouldn't have to choose between their health and their civic duty.
485	2020-04-08 16:44:05+00:00	I am directing flags be flown at half-mast in honor of those we have lost to this vicious virus. They are in our hearts.
486	2020-04-08 16:42:10+00:00	Tragically, New York lost an additional 779 people yesterday to COVID-19. They are more than just a statistic. Every number is a face. Every number is a family. We mourn these New Yorkers deeply.
487	2020-04-08 16:37:25+00:00	Social distancing is working. We took dramatic action. It is flattening the curve. What we are all doing is having an impact. We can’t stop now.

This is a challenging time, but we must practice social distancing to protect our community and save lives.

497	2020-04-07 16:17:14+00:00	It's all about testing, testing, testing. We have done more testing than any state in the nation, but we need to do even more. Private companies: If you are interested in working with us to accelerate testing methods, call 212-803-3100 or email covid19supplies@esd.ny.gov.
498	2020-04-07 15:27:50+00:00	Social distancing is working. We need to vigorously maintain it. Lives depend on it. This is not about any one of us — it’s about all of us.
499	2020-04-07 15:19:23+00:00	We cannot restart life as we knew it without testing. Testing is the essential component. The NYS Dept of Health has developed antibody testing and is working with the FDA to bring it to scale We are working with NJ & CT to ensure we move forward using a regional approach.
500	2020-04-07 15:16:27+00:00	For our hospitals to function they need three things: Beds, Staff, Equipment. Every day we are balancing the needs of each hospital in each category. The USNS Comfort and the Javits Center are adding 3,000 much-needed beds.
501	2020-04-07 15:14:00+00:00	Our hearts go out to New Jersey. After NY, New Jersey has lost the most people to this vicious virus. Our thoughts are with our brothers and sisters across the Hudson. We are all #NewYorkTough and we are all #JerseyStrong.

511	2020-04-06 16:27:10+00:00	We can’t underestimate the extreme emotional trauma that many people are feeling now. We thank @Headspace for their partnership to offer New Yorkers much-needed free meditation and mindfulness content as a mental health resource. Check it out here:
512	2020-04-06 16:24:21+00:00	New York on PAUSE is extended through April 29. Schools and non-essential businesses will remain closed. Public health is our first concern.
513	2020-04-06 16:23:12+00:00	Hospitals are pulling off miracles on a daily basis. But it is a monumental challenge to sustain this pace. I will ask the federal government to allow the USNS Comfort to treat COVID patients to serve as a relief valve for our stressed hospital system.
514	2020-04-06 16:21:46+00:00	Early projections (in orange & blue) showed we would need 55K to 110K hospital beds. The purple line shows where we are. We are tracking better than the initial models, which is good news. Social distancing appears to be working. We must keep it up.

532	2020-04-04 15:18:03+00:00	We finally got some good news today. The Chinese government helped facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive in JFK today. I thank the Chinese government, Jack Ma, Joe Tsai, the Jack Ma Foundation, the Tsai Foundation and Consul General Huang.
533	2020-04-04 15:11:23+00:00	The Federal Government will staff and equip 2,500 beds in Javits for COVID patients. This is a dramatic help in our battle against time, spread and lacking hospital capacity. Reducing the strain on NYC area hospitals is a top priority.

539	2020-04-03 15:38:00+00:00	Helping one another is in the American DNA. When I put out the call, 20,000 out-of-state health professionals volunteered to come to NY. We thank you. At this time when we’re dealing with our worst let’s deploy America at its best. Enlist:
540	2020-04-03 15:30:26+00:00	The timing won’t be perfect. Multiple states may hit a peak around the same time. But not every state will hit an apex at once. That’s why I believe Mutual Aid is the only solution. We need a rolling deployment of resources. We need a national coordinated effort.
541	2020-04-03 15:25:55+00:00	This virus is not an issue of states’ rights. This is a national disaster. The states need federal assistance. No state can get all the ventilators they need. We need a national deployment of resources that follows need.
542	2020-04-03 15:20:05+00:00	We do not have enough ventilators. Period. I am signing an Executive Order allowing the state to take ventilators and redistribute to hospitals in need. The National Guard will be mobilized to move ventilators to where they are urgently required to save lives.

598	2020-03-30 16:49:48+00:00	After the hate-fueled attack in Monsey, I vowed to enact a law that calls this violence & hate what it is—domestic terrorism—and punishes perpetrators accordingly. I will rename this bill in honor of Josef & I call on the Legislature to pass it. We owe it to him to get it done.
599	2020-03-30 16:49:48+00:00	New York is heartbroken by the death of Josef Neumann, who was brutally attacked during a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey three months ago. This hate-motivated attack shook us to our core. Any attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.
600	2020-03-30 16:15:30+00:00	We will fight every way we can to save every life we can. Thank you, USNS Comfort. Welcome to New York.

602	2020-03-30 15:00:38+00:00	Welcome to New York, @USNSComfort. We knew from the outset that expanded hospital capacity was critical. We asked and the federal government answered. This ship is a step forward in our fight against Coronavirus.
603	2020-03-30 14:20:00+00:00	The USNS Comfort seen sailing to New York Harbor from a NYS escort vessel. The Comfort brings 1,000 much-needed hospital beds & 1,200 personnel to New York. I'll be in NYC to receive a briefing upon its arrival.
604	2020-03-30 13:05:41+00:00	To each and every doctor putting his or her life at risk to save the lives of others, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You are the unwavering front line soldiers, angels and heroes in this war. You make New York proud. #NationalDoctorsDay
605	2020-03-29 21:40:34+00:00	NY wasn’t helped by the federal legislation. We received less than other states despite having the most COVID-19 cases. I spoke to Senators Schumer, Gillibrand & Speaker Pelosi & they have committed to right this wrong. I am committed to working with them.

609	2020-03-29 16:24:45+00:00	I'm heartbroken that New York lost Detective Cedric Dixon, a 23-year veteran from the 23rd @NYPD Precinct, to coronavirus.

610	2020-03-29 16:15:43+00:00	New York State on PAUSE is extended to April 15. That means the non-essential workforce is directed to continue to work from home until at least April 15. We will re-evaluate every two weeks.
611	2020-03-29 16:12:41+00:00	Normally, every individual hospital operates on its own, and there is a wall between public and private hospitals. We have to change that structure quickly. We need all our hospitals to work together. It's all hands on deck.

620	2020-03-28 16:31:19+00:00	There is a concern that the CDC guidelines on PPE are not adequately protecting our nurses & doctors. We're aware of the concerns & we're actively looking into it. If the guidelines don’t sufficiently protect our health care professionals, we'll put our own guidelines in place.
621	2020-03-28 16:27:44+00:00	In projections we trust. For projections we plan. Accordingly we need 30,000 ventilators.

630	2020-03-27 16:14:17+00:00	I hope NY doesn’t ultimately need 30,000 ventilators. But I don't operate on opinion and hope. I operate on facts and data and science. All the projections say we will need 30,000-40,000 ventilators. So that is what we will strive to have.
631	2020-03-27 16:02:29+00:00	New Yorkers never cease to amaze me. The outpouring of support is extraordinary. 62K medical staff have answered our call to help. Over 10K mental healthcare workers have answered our call to help. When someone needs something, there’s no place I’d rather be than New York.
632	2020-03-27 15:54:12+00:00	We mourn the 519 New Yorkers lost to this vicious virus. This is the worst news I can give New Yorkers. It is heartbreaking. Sadly, we expect this number to rise as patients who have been on ventilators for weeks succumb. We will keep fighting to save every life we can.
633	2020-03-27 15:49:10+00:00	With #COVID19 spreading quickly, our number one priority is expanding hospital capacity. All NY hospitals are increasing capacity by 50%, some by 100%. We have also identified 4 new temp hospital sites. One in the Bronx, one in Queens, one in Brooklyn &amp; one in Staten Island.
634	2020-03-27 15:45:40+00:00	Schools will remain closed statewide until at least April 15 to reduce the spread of #COVID19. School districts will continue to provide childcare, meals and daily programming. We will reassess at that time.

683	2020-03-24 15:07:55+00:00	We had projected a need for 110K hospital beds at the apex of this virus. The rate of infection is INCREASING and the curve has increased.

We are ordering that every hospital MUST increase capacity by at least 50%. Every hospital must do its part to expand capacity.
706	2020-03-22 15:24:18+00:00	After touring sites yesterday, I'm asking the Army Corps of Engineers to immediately erect temporary hospitals in 4 locations. I'm also asking for four 250-bed FEMA field hospitals. The facilities are open. No red tape. In my point of view, construction could start tomorrow.
707	2020-03-22 15:13:22+00:00	I’m calling on the Federal Government to nationalize the medical supply chain. The Federal Government should immediately use the Defense Production Act to order companies to make gowns, masks and gloves. Currently, states are competing against other states for supplies.

This isn't our first rodeo — we are fully coordinated, fully mobilized, and fully prepared to deal with this situation as it develops.
912	2020-03-02 16:32:05+00:00	NY is providing hospitals with guidance on replicating the State's FDA-approved #coronavirus test so we can quickly reach our goal of 1,000 tests per day. We have the best healthcare system in the world &amp; we are leveraging that system to help contain any spread of #COVID19.
913	2020-03-02 14:53:31+00:00	Gov. Cuomo Holds Briefing on First Confirmed Case of Coronavirus in NYS
914	2020-03-02 13:22:00+00:00	UPDATE: The #COVID19 patient lives in Manhattan &amp; had no symptoms upon arrival. She is a health care worker; she knew to take precautions &amp; didn't take public transportation. Remember this was not a question of if, but when. We are prepared. We can’t allow fear to outpace reason
915	2020-03-02 00:51:35+00:00	We have learned of the 1st positive case of COVID-19 in NY. The patient contracted the virus while in Iran & is isolated There is no reason for undue anxiety—the general risk remains low in NY. We are diligently managing this situation &will provide info as it becomes available.
916	2020-03-01 21:40:00+00:00	Many people with the flu can't afford to stay home from work without pay and they risk spreading the virus when they come into work sick. We need to pass #PaidSickLeave to help our workers and make our workplaces safer. It's a matter of personal AND public health.
917	2020-03-01 21:00:49+00:00	Happy 93rd Birthday to Harry Belafonte — singer, songwriter, civil rights leader, and New York legend. He led the effort in NYS with my father to establish #MLKDay, and has dedicated his life to social justice. Celebrating Harry &amp; his achievements today.
918	2020-03-01 20:32:50+00:00	Being able to take a sick day shouldn’t be a luxury. Having #PaidSickLeave for everyone is crucial for keeping viruses like the novel coronavirus from spreading.

920	2020-03-01 16:18:24+00:00	Inclusion and tolerance make New York what it is. LGBTQ Staten Islanders should be able to celebrate their Irish heritage and culture just like anyone else. I stand in full solidarity with @pridecenterSI 
921	2020-03-01 14:00:00+00:00	This #WomensHistoryMonth, let's celebrate the extraordinary women who have made history — and the women who are making history now. New York State will keep on fighting until we achieve true gender equality.
922	2020-02-29 21:55:28+00:00	The NRA are a bunch of political bullies who control politicians in DC & across the country, but they don't control me, & they don't control NY, and that's why they're scared. If the NRA goes away, I'll remember them in my thoughts and prayers.
923	2020-02-29 20:10:11+00:00	It's a great day on Long Island when Butch Goring's number is retired on the same day it's official that the @NYIslanders are coming home! They’ll be playing all home games next season at the Coliseum. After that, they’ll move into the new world-class Belmont arena. #Isles
924	2020-02-29 18:10:06+00:00	The @NYIslanders have always been Long Island’s team. Honored to announce that the Islanders are coming home for good – one year ahead of schedule! #Isles
925	2020-02-29 16:44:04+00:00	New York State’s Wadsworth Lab will begin testing immediately.
926	2020-02-29 16:34:39+00:00	BREAKING: When I spoke to @VP, I urged him to approve New York State’s #coronavirus test — we just received word that our test has been approved by the FDA. This will expedite wait time and improve NY’s ability to more effectively manage the coronavirus situation as it unfolds.

928	2020-02-28 22:59:39+00:00	It wouldn’t be a problem if everyone had #PaidSickLeave
929	2020-02-28 20:23:26+00:00	Congrats!

931	2020-02-28 18:07:23+00:00	Starting this Sunday, single-use plastic bags will no longer be allowed in New York. Make sure you're ready to #BYOBagNY.
932	2020-02-28 15:38:56+00:00	A Blizzard Warning remains in effect in parts of Upstate New York including Oswego, Jefferson, and Lewis Counties. Avoid travel if you live in the affected areas and stay safe!
933	2020-02-28 12:26:44+00:00	Happening soon: Appearing on @JayOliverLINews this morning at 7:45am. Listen here: https://radio.securenetsystems.net/cwa/WRCN
934	2020-02-28 00:00:41+00:00	Surrogates do what they do out of love. They are heroes to the families they help and become part of their families. Passing the #ChildParentSecurityAct will not only legalize surrogacy but ensure protections for both the intended parents and the surrogates. #LoveMakesAFamilyNY
935	2020-02-27 19:59:36+00:00	New Yorkers stand up for one another. That's who we are. I'm so inspired by the hundreds of messages we have received from New Yorkers who are standing in solidarity with victims of recent hate crimes. I'll be sharing a message every day in the coming days. #NoHateInOurState
936	2020-02-27 18:12:06+00:00	The surge in hate crimes we have seen across the country, including New York, is a call to action. Today I'm launching the #NoHateInOurState Campaign to combat anti-Semitism and all forms of hate. Add your name in solidarity:
937	2020-02-27 00:23:46+00:00	Multiple innocent people were killed in yet another mass shooting, this time in Milwaukee. My heart breaks for the victims. The federal government’s inaction is shameful. How many innocent lives will it take? Enough is enough.
938	2020-02-26 22:17:57+00:00	Today Congress moved one step closer to correcting a shameful omission in federal civil rights law by passing legislation designating lynching as a federal hate crime. I urge the Senate & House to quickly reconcile their bills & deliver this legislation to the President to sign.
939	2020-02-26 21:39:29+00:00	It's ridiculous how much more women will spend on shampoo, razors, and other products because of the #PinkTax. These costs add up when they shouldn't even exist in the first place. The Pink Tax needs to go. Now.
940	2020-02-26 19:30:20+00:00	There are still zero confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NYS. 26 samples have been tested by CDC and came back negative. One is still pending. If you have concerns about symptoms or travel, New Yorkers call the DOH hotline at 1-888-364-3065.
941	2020-02-26 19:30:20+00:00	This is not a situation that should cause undue fear among New Yorkers. For perspective, we've had 17,000 people in NYS last week who tested positive with the flu. We've dealt with situations like this in the past and we will deal with it again.
942	2020-02-26 19:30:19+00:00	Additionally, @HealthNYGov will convene conferences with local health departments and hospitals statewide to review protocols &amp; procedures. DOH will also work closely with @MTA and @PANYNJ.
943	2020-02-26 19:30:19+00:00	A new $40 million emergency appropriation will allow @HealthNYGov to hire additional staff and procure equipment and other resources they need to respond to any emergency situation that may arise.
944	2020-02-26 19:30:19+00:00	As we see the novel #coronavirus spread, we are continuing to take all necessary precautions to protect New Yorkers from this virus. Today I'm announcing new actions to help ensure our healthcare systems &amp; hospitals are equipped to respond to a potential COVID-19 pandemic.
945	2020-02-26 18:45:29+00:00	Gov. Cuomo Holds Briefing on COVID-19 Coronavirus
946	2020-02-26 15:30:08+00:00	New Yorkers shouldn't have to worry about job security because they are sick. #PaidSickLeave is a right everyone should have. Join me to support Paid Sick Leave for New York's workforce.
947	2020-02-25 21:30:48+00:00	Transgender people face discrimination and violence every single day. And too often, it’s fatal. My heart goes out to Neulisa Luciano Ruiz's loved ones. NY stands with the trans community, now and always.
948	2020-02-25 20:31:59+00:00	Honored to be joined by @OfficialMLK3 and hundreds of faith leaders from across New York to spread the word about the #2020Census! It’s important that all New Yorkers complete the 2020 Census. If you don’t get counted, you don’t count. #GetCountedNY
949	2020-02-24 18:44:36+00:00	Katherine Johnson was a trailblazer and a true American hero. She broke down racial barriers and leaves behind a legacy that reaches the stars. Rest in peace to this remarkable woman.
950	2020-02-23 18:53:30+00:00	Bomb threats were made by email today against multiple Jewish Community Centers across NY. At @AlbanyJCC, police evacuated the building, then declared it safe. An investigation into the threats is ongoing. NY has zero tolerance for anti-Semitism — we won't let hate &amp; fear win.
951	2020-02-23 03:38:31+00:00	My thoughts are with @GovMurphy and his entire family as we wish him a full and speedy recovery. NY has your back, Governor.
952	2020-02-22 20:49:27+00:00	40 years ago today! The U.S. hockey team beat the USSR in the #MiracleOnIce in Lake Placid, New York, 4-3. An iconic moment of sports history for the nation and for the North Country.
953	2020-02-21 22:03:03+00:00	The Trump administration will fail in their attempts to extort New York State into turning over our DMV database so that they can deport law abiding undocumented families. I will never allow use of the DMV database for immigration actions. My full statement:
954	2020-02-21 18:39:18+00:00	Concerns about coronavirus are NOT an excuse for racism or xenophobia. This discrimination is appalling. I stand in full solidarity with Chinese New Yorkers. #NoHateInOurState
955	2020-02-20 20:00:33+00:00	Happy National #LoveYourPetDay from me and Captain! 
956	2020-02-20 19:39:48+00:00	Vaping is a public health risk – they're cigarettes in a different wrapper. The dangers to our youth are evident. We must keep our children safe and prevent them from forming unhealthy and life-long addictions. Sign your name and share your story. #NoVapeNY
957	2020-02-20 00:26:25+00:00	In New York, we know that diversity is our greatest strength. I stand in solidarity with @pridecenterSI in their fight to finally march in Staten Island’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade. Let's speak out for unity and tolerance. #StatenIrelandPride
958	2020-02-19 20:17:03+00:00	The Pinta Island tortoise was believed to be extinct for nearly a decade. Thanks to a SUNY ESF professor & team, the species has been found again! Congrats on this great discovery — the latest example of world-class research by @SUNY faculty &amp; students.
959	2020-02-19 19:55:36+00:00	A Winter Storm Watch is currently in effect for areas near Lake Ontario and Central NY. Lake effect snow will quickly move across areas upstate and I urge New Yorkers to exercise caution during their evening and morning commutes.
960	2020-02-18 19:39:00+00:00	Last October I was proud to sign legislation that prohibits pelvic exams on anesthetized or unconscious patients in NY. No one should ever have to question what was done to their body while unconscious in a healthcare setting. It's repugnant.
961	2020-02-17 18:10:38+00:00	Incredible weekend hitting the trails in the North Country with my girls...look forward to toasting it with ‘The Governor’s IPA’ from @Swiftwaterbeer in Rochester
962	2020-02-16 18:29:18+00:00	Great time snowmobiling with Cara, Mariah and Michaela at Saranac Lake! NY is home to more than 10,000 miles of some of the best snowmobiling trails in the nation. Come out for a FREE snowmobiling weekend on March 14-15: https://bit.ly/2SvQ9V2
963	2020-02-15 15:57:38+00:00	You can't use the government to come up with an arbitrary policy that hurts hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers to make a political point. It's an abuse of power. It is extortion. https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-punishing-new-york-smacks-of-retribution/2020/02/14/74fd1f48-4cf7-11ea-9b5c-eac5b16dafaa_story.html
