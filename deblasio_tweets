1	2020-05-24 16:26:01+00:00	Veterinarian Julie Butler served Harlem. Her motto was, “if you have it to give, you give.” Ilona Murai lit up Broadway stages. Idris Bey trained @FDNY EMTs to become New York’s Best. Our country has lost nearly 100,000 lives to COVID-19. Know their names. Know their stories.
2	2020-05-24 14:54:47+00:00	JUST IN: Hospital admissions and positive tests for COVID-19 are looking good — and the number of patients in @NYCHealthSystem ICUs continues to drop. The strategies are working. Social distancing is working. What you’re doing is working, New York City. Keep it up.
3	2020-05-24 00:30:23+00:00	The Wonder Wheel is one hundred years old this weekend — but it feels timeless. The countless memories it’s created for New Yorkers and visitors alike define summer in our city. We’ll all be back enjoying Coney Island soon, New York City. Have faith.
4	2020-05-24 00:00:00+00:00	I want to wish a warm Eid ul-Fitr to the Muslim community as they end Ramadan. I know this was a Ramadan unlike any other but we NEED these holidays during this crisis. It reminds us of our faith, it reminds us to endure and that we will come out of this stronger than before.
5	2020-05-23 18:23:45+00:00	The Highbridge Recreation Center in Washington Heights is one of more than 100 testing sites across New York City. THIS is how we'll push back the virus. Go to http://nyc.gov/covidtest to find a site near you. It's quick, safe, free and will help us get back to the city we love.
6	2020-05-23 13:12:12+00:00	Bit by bit, the widespread testing we’ve needed since the COVID-19 crisis began is starting to come into place. Find a testing site near you at http://nyc.gov/covidtest — and keep your questions coming using the hashtag #AskMyMayor.
7	2020-05-22 23:37:00+00:00	Few places in our country have endured what the Bronx has endured during this pandemic. But few places in the country have a team like @NYCHealthSystem-Jacobi. These heroes are fighting COVID-19 with everything they’ve got. #ClapBecauseWeCare
8	2020-05-22 22:52:00+00:00	We’ll continue to work closely with faith leaders to ensure people can safely worship during these stressful times, but we will not take any steps that could jeopardize the safety and health of our city.
9	2020-05-22 22:52:00+00:00	Houses of Worship never closed in New York City and many have been helping their communities through this crisis. But ALL Houses of Worship have been under reasonable capacity requirements that prohibit large gatherings and that’s not changing.
10	2020-05-22 21:28:01+00:00	I need every New Yorker to heed the warning: there’s NO swimming on our beaches during this crisis. It is NOT safe. We don’t want want to fence off the beaches but we will if we have to. We’ll have extra Parks and NYPD walking the beaches this weekend to keep New Yorkers safe.
11	2020-05-22 21:27:04+00:00	We just lost a young man who got caught in a dangerous current in the Rockaways. Our hearts break for his family and his friends.
12	2020-05-22 20:08:21+00:00	We are living in incredibly stressful times, but no one needs to struggle alone. If you need someone to talk to, pick up the phone and call 1-888-NYC-Well. Counselors are standing by.
13	2020-05-22 20:08:21+00:00	This was a truly scary situation on the Brooklyn Bridge — but it wasn’t a tragic one thanks to the men and women of the NYPD. This is why we call them New York’s Finest.
14	2020-05-22 18:55:54+00:00	@NYCParks and the NYPD will be out on our beaches, encouraging social distancing, educating New Yorkers and passing out face coverings. If we see people violating the rules, it's not working, we will fence off the beaches. We don't want to do that — but public safety comes first.
15	2020-05-22 18:55:53+00:00	City beaches will be CLOSED for swimming, sports games, barbecues or large gatherings. They’re only open for walking and sitting. The NYPD will increase its Summer Beach Detail by 30% and @NYCParks will have 159 staff at our beaches. Parking lots will close at 50% capacity.
16	2020-05-22 18:55:52+00:00	Memorial Day is about remembering something bigger than all of us. It's about honoring heroes who gave their lives for us. It’s also the unofficial start of summer. If you want to go back to the things we love then you CANNOT let your guard down this weekend.
17	2020-05-22 18:44:27+00:00	Open Streets are a great way to stay safe outside. There are 30 miles of car-free streets open now and we’ll open 13 more miles tomorrow. That’s more than any city in the nation. We found a model that works while getting New Yorkers something to enjoy during this crisis.
18	2020-05-22 13:44:33+00:00	We're at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
19	2020-05-22 00:55:08+00:00	Throughout this crisis, @NYCParks employees kept the parks open, creating oases for so many. They gave out face coverings, they helped us practice social distancing and they put together field hospitals during our darkest hour. We applaud their dedication! #GoingGreenforParkies
20	2020-05-21 22:32:53+00:00	I met with our construction, real estate and infrastructure council last night. There was an energy on the call to think anew, put together plans and employ a huge number of people. There are lots of pioneers ready to restart when the time comes and that should give us hope.
21	2020-05-21 20:54:41+00:00	For two weeks the MTA has closed down the subways overnight to clean. In that same time, our outreach teams have helped more than 200 homeless New Yorkers come in and STAY off the streets. This is a MAJOR step in reducing and preventing street homelessness once and for all.
22	2020-05-21 20:22:16+00:00	THIS is what it's all about. THIS is why we work every day to help New Yorkers through the COVID-19 crisis and beyond. Because residents like Sylvia are depending on us. We won't let them down.
23	2020-05-21 19:55:36+00:00	300 officers will join 10 commands in neighborhoods hard hit by gun violence. These officers have already built strong relationships in these neighborhoods. This approach helped us become the safest big city in America and build a stronger a bond between police and community.
24	2020-05-21 19:55:35+00:00	Every summer, we confront the scourge of gun violence. We have a proven strategy to protect neighborhoods: Summer All Out.
25	2020-05-21 19:26:23+00:00	This system is new. It’s not yet perfect, and we’re working every day to make it even stronger. If you need food, pick up the phone TODAY and call 311 or go to http://nyc.gov/getfood. We will get you the meals you deserve.
26	2020-05-21 19:19:59+00:00	BIG NEWS: Staten Island Ferry service is INCREASING. We reduced trips after ridership dropped 90% — but we’re able to increase frequency from hourly at rush hour to every 30 minutes from 5-9am and 3:30-7:30pm. This will begin TODAY.
27	2020-05-21 18:32:19+00:00	Today Chirlane and I gave blood and I’m asking you to do it as well. COVID-19 has disrupted the normal blood drives and the New York Blood Center supply is very low. If you’re able, go to http://nybc.org. You can literally help save a life.
28	2020-05-21 18:06:07+00:00	In the past two months we’ve served 32 million meals to New Yorkers in need. By next week, we’ll have 1 million meals delivered PER DAY and another 500,000 meals per day distributed from Grab-and-Go meal sites.
29	2020-05-21 18:06:07+00:00	Think about the hardworking New Yorkers suddenly without a job, without enough money to feed their family. The COVID-19 crisis has far reaching effects and we don’t know when it will end. But we do know one thing: NO New Yorker will go hungry. Period.
30	2020-05-21 13:46:08+00:00	I’m at City Hall with a COVID-19 update. Tune in:
31	2020-05-20 23:00:00+00:00	THIS is what a frontline looks like. With the world watching, health care heroes like the team at @NYCHealthSystem in Queens have been saving lives and inspiring a city. #ClapBecauseWeCare
32	2020-05-20 18:45:52+00:00	The census is for EVERYONE. Regardless of immigration status. But just 49% of the city has responded. We can do better New York City! Go to http://my2020census.gov and fill yours out.
33	2020-05-20 18:45:20+00:00	Right now we’re fighting to get New York City’s fair due from Washington to beat back COVID-19. But we’re also in a battle that will affect what we get for the next DECADE: the 2020 Census.
34	2020-05-20 18:18:27+00:00	GET YOUR CHILD VACCINATED. This is essential. Free vaccines are available at over 1,000 New York City facilities and @NYCHealthSystem is offering free vaccines at all clinics. Don’t wait another day. Call 844-NYC-4NYC to make an appointment.
35	2020-05-20 18:18:27+00:00	This should worry every parent: the number of kids getting their usual vaccines in this crisis has fallen A LOT. Over the last 6 weeks, we’ve seen them drop 63%. That is shocking. But it's something we can address IMMEDIATELY.
36	2020-05-20 17:46:30+00:00	We will also build up our reserve to ensure we're never caught in a situation where we have to depend on others again. By the end of this year we will have a 90-day supply of PPE and 4,000 full-service ventilators. This will be ready no matter what is thrown at us in the future.
37	2020-05-20 17:46:30+00:00	The scarcity we saw in terms of PPE was SHOCKING in the world’s richest country. We had to maximize production right here in New York City and we’re through the worst of it. I can now say, we have enough PPEs to get us through the rest of May.
38	2020-05-20 17:17:53+00:00	Chirlane and I have never been more overwhelmed than when we were raising our own kids and trying to help our older parents live independently while their health was declining. It is so hard on families. Let’s make this the moment we start making it EASIER.
39	2020-05-20 17:17:53+00:00	This crisis should be a wake-up call: for some, a nursing home is the only place to get the care they need. But we know many of our parents and grandparents would have a better quality of life at home if we could find ways to get the right health care and support to them.
40	2020-05-20 17:17:53+00:00	We’re going to step in to ensure nursing homes can stop future outbreaks in their tracks. We will have 10 outbreak response teams to reinforce any nursing home that’s seeing a surge in COVID cases to keep residents and staff safe.
41	2020-05-20 17:17:53+00:00	We can’t have a situation where nursing homes don’t have the staff they need to take care of our elders. We've sent 240 additional staff to nursing homes citywide and by next week, every staffing request WILL be filled.
42	2020-05-20 17:17:53+00:00	This is new: New York City is stepping in to offer COVID-19 testing to every nursing home resident in New York City. As many as 3,000 tests a day if needed, with all the test kits and lab capacity to go with it. Our parents and grandparents need to be safe.
43	2020-05-20 13:44:34+00:00	We’re at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19
44	2020-05-19 23:00:59+00:00	The COVID-19 test is SAFE — and free testing is now available at two more locations. If you have symptoms, have been in close contact with someone who tested positive or if you work in a nursing home, shelter or adult care facility, don't wait, get tested: http://nyc.gov/covidtest
45	2020-05-19 21:23:22+00:00	That’s why I’ll be working with partners in Albany on state legislation to authorize line of duty death benefits for New York City public employees so we can do right by their families.
46	2020-05-19 21:23:21+00:00	We’re fighting for more benefits for the surviving families of public employees in Washington, but there’s more we can do right here.
47	2020-05-19 20:50:29+00:00	She’s going to help us use every tool we have to fight disparities in New York City, and make sure more minority and women-owned business owners are a part of rebuilding our economy.
48	2020-05-19 20:50:28+00:00	Magalie Austin will serve as the new Director and Senior Advisor for the Mayor’s Office of Minority and Women-owned Businesses and Enterprises.
49	2020-05-19 20:50:28+00:00	The people suffering the most from COVID-19 are low income, people of color and immigrants. That’s the reality. On top of that, they’re also being hit with an economic crisis.
50	2020-05-19 19:47:39+00:00	This is #EMSWeek. So much has been asked of our @FDNY EMS in this crisis. A few weeks ago they experienced the most 911 calls in history and they held the line. They are true heroes who went through so much to save lives.
51	2020-05-19 19:03:57+00:00	We need all parents and caregivers to call your health care provider or 311 at the first sign of symptoms. Early detection is absolutely critical.
52	2020-05-19 19:03:56+00:00	The CDC has linked the following to Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: -Persistent fever -Irritability or sluggishness -Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting -Rash -Red or pink eyes -Enlarged lymph nodes -Red cracked lips or red tongue -Swollen hands and feet
53	2020-05-19 17:54:25+00:00	As of today 284,000 iPads have been delivered to students, 5,000 more have been shipped and you can STILL sign up if your child needs a device. Call 311 or go to http://schools.nyc.gov.
54	2020-05-19 17:54:25+00:00	We are working with private partners, libraries and museums to launch new resources and activities to keep ALL students engaged this summer. We’re working on ideas like virtual clubs, virtual field trips, educational TV and radio programming, academic acceleration and more.
55	2020-05-19 17:54:24+00:00	ALL students in all grade levels participating in remote summer learning will participate in enrichment activities including virtual field trips, community building and social emotional learning.
56	2020-05-19 17:54:24+00:00	Students with disabilities in all grades will receive remote summer learning five days per week for six weeks. Students will have 5.5 hours of instruction and related services daily aligned to Individualized Education Programs.
57	2020-05-19 17:54:24+00:00	Grades 9-12 will have summer learning five days per week for six weeks. Students will only have to attend for the classes they need credits for. They will also have small group and 1-1 check-ins remotely.
58	2020-05-19 17:54:23+00:00	For grades 3-8, summer learning will occur four days per week for six weeks. Remote learning will cover math and English Language Arts daily in live or pre-recorded instruction, in small groups and 1-1 check-ins. Guidance counselors or social workers will also check in with kids.
59	2020-05-19 17:54:23+00:00	The last day of school will be Friday, June 26th. We’re setting up summer learning that can serve 175,000 kids or more. Summer learning will begin: July 1 - August 13 for students with disabilities July 13 - August 18 for grades 3-8 July 13th - August 21 for grades 9-12
60	2020-05-19 17:54:22+00:00	Remote learning has NEVER been done on this large a scale. We know it hasn’t been easy, but parents, teachers and students are making it work! Now we’re planning to take Summer Learning online as well so kids can start the next school year strong.
61	2020-05-19 13:45:42+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
62	2020-05-19 01:28:44+00:00	On #HaitianFlagDay we pause to honor the contributions of our Haitian community, one of the oldest and largest in the country. As we speak, Haitian New Yorkers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 fight in our hospitals and essential businesses — we cannot thank them enough.
63	2020-05-18 22:23:13+00:00	Earlier today the NYPD shut down a Yeshiva conducting classes with as many as 70 children. I can’t stress how dangerous this is for our young people. We’re issuing a Cease and Desist Order and will make sure we keep our communities and our kids safe.
64	2020-05-18 20:42:35+00:00	We won’t let ANY New Yorker go hungry during the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s my vow to you. We’re proud to work with the @NYCCouncil to make sure organizations like @ProjHospitality have the resources they need to get the job done. Head to http://nyc.gov/getfood for more.
65	2020-05-18 19:42:04+00:00	To our Asian American community: New York City sees you and stands with you. @NYCFirstLady and I are proud to join @ActToChange on the Asian American &amp; Pacific Islander Day Against Bullying and Hate. #APAHM
66	2020-05-18 18:56:43+00:00	Anyone who has had to care for a parent or older loved one knows that long term care givers aren’t just health care workers — they’re family. We have to recognize how much is on their shoulders because of the COVID-19 crisis. Your city thanks you!
67	2020-05-18 18:05:57+00:00	If you see these symptoms, call your health care provider immediately. If you don't have a health care provider, call 311. We are taking this new reality very seriously and we will do everything we can to keep our children safe.
68	2020-05-18 18:05:57+00:00	Early detection is CRUCIAL. These are the symptoms to watch for: -Persistent fever -Irritability or sluggishness -Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting -Rash -Red or pink eyes -Enlarged lymph nodes -Red cracked lips or red tongue -Swollen hands and feet
69	2020-05-18 18:05:56+00:00	A painful and sober topic: we have been monitoring and tracking Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome in our children. The CDC has now released key updates, officially linking it to COVID-19. We will work together to learn how to fight back.
70	2020-05-18 17:06:11+00:00	Testing is voluntary and we’re starting with @FDNY and Medical Examiner employees. Sign up at http://firstserosurveynyc.com or text TESTNYC to 78378.
71	2020-05-18 17:06:11+00:00	We are testing first responders in coordination with the federal government and I want to thank @HHSGov and @CDCgov for helping us get this done free of charge.
72	2020-05-18 17:06:11+00:00	The antibody test helps you understand if you’ve previously been exposed. In the coming weeks we will test 140,000 first responders and health care workers and an additional 140,000 every-day New Yorkers.
73	2020-05-18 17:06:10+00:00	Two additional @NYCHealthSystem community testing sites opened today in Washington Heights and Midwood, bringing the total to 25. Go to http://nyc.gov/covidtest to find one near you.
74	2020-05-18 17:06:10+00:00	Our testing capacity is GROWING. We're adding more testing sites, more tracers, more labs, all coming together to get us to the next phase.
75	2020-05-18 17:06:09+00:00	By then end of this week we'll have more than 60,000 New York City-made testing kits delivered. We will go as far as we can to make sure that every New Yorker who needs a COVID-19 test can get one. This is how we keep beating back this disease.
76	2020-05-18 17:06:09+00:00	We've made COVID-19 testing possible right here in New York City. With our local partners @PrintParts, @Collabnyc and @EinsteinMed we now have made in NYC test kits being used at @NYCHealthSystem community testing sites. This is just the beginning.
77	2020-05-18 17:00:54+00:00	Alternate Side Parking is BACK this week. It will be suspended Thursday for Ascension Day and will continue through Saturday, May 23. We want to do a clean sweep, as litter is starting to accumulate. It’ll be suspended again starting on Sunday, May 24.
78	2020-05-18 13:42:56+00:00	Join us at City Hall for a COVID-19 update.
79	2020-05-17 20:22:34+00:00	If you want to walk or sit on the beach that’s allowed as usual this time of year. But: No swimming No parties No sports If we see people flouting those safety rules, we will have to fence off the beaches. We CANNOT move backwards after all the progress we’ve made.
80	2020-05-17 20:22:33+00:00	BUT we’re holding out hope we’ll make the progress we need beating this disease back so we can open later this summer. We’re training lifeguards so if and when it’s safe to reopen beaches, we’ll be able to do so.
81	2020-05-17 20:22:33+00:00	A reminder: New York City will NOT open up its beaches on Memorial Day. We’re not out of the woods yet, and it’s just not safe for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers to hop on the subways and buses for non-essential travel and crowd the beaches.
82	2020-05-17 19:54:23+00:00	We’re doing everything we can to protect you and now we need YOU to help protect everyone in this city. If you’re able, we need you to give blood right away. The New York Blood Center supply is very low. We need you now. Go to http://nybc.org or call 800-933-2566.
83	2020-05-17 19:35:18+00:00	We are deeply concerned about Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome. Every caregiver in New York City needs to watch for persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting. If you see symptoms, call a health care provider or 311 IMMEDIATELY. Early detection saves lives.
84	2020-05-17 19:16:24+00:00	We’re testing 140,000 New Yorkers for antibodies, so they’ll know if they had COVID-19 before. That’ll be helpful for them and helpful for us as a city tracking how far the disease spread. It’s free, by appointment only. Go to http://nyc.gov/antibodysurvey to learn more.
85	2020-05-17 18:47:09+00:00	We'll hire up to 300 Resource Navigators to make sure people isolating after a positive COVID-19 test have what they need. Everything from food to medicine to a phone to stay in touch. This is a proven approach and we’ll do it on an unprecedented scale in New York City.
86	2020-05-17 18:47:09+00:00	We're building an army of tracers. We have 500 tracers who have now completed Johns Hopkins training program and another 1,000 in progress. The week of May 24th, they’ll start learning in the field. We will have 1,000 tracers ready to go by the end of the month.
87	2020-05-17 18:47:09+00:00	We’ve hit our goal of a capacity of 20,000 tests per day ahead of schedule. We hit it a week early and we’ll keep rolling.
88	2020-05-17 18:47:09+00:00	We’re standing up a Test & Trace Corps that will beat back this disease by making sure any New Yorker who needs a COVID-19 test can get one quickly, that people who test positive can easily isolate, and that any close contacts they’ve had can get tested too.
89	2020-05-17 18:47:09+00:00	BIG news today. It just got a whole lot easier to get a test for COVID-19. We are partnering with City MD to make diagnostic testing available at their sites across all five boroughs. That's an additional 6,000 tests per day and will be FREE to those without insurance.
90	2020-05-17 13:43:33+00:00	Join me at City Hall for a COVID-19 update.
91	2020-05-16 23:43:56+00:00	Listen to the experts: face coverings WORK. Free coverings like the ones we handed out in Flushing Meadows Park are helping us beat back COVID-19. We’re handing out 7.5 million of them. Learn more: http://nyc.gov/facecoverings
92	2020-05-16 20:51:47+00:00	The only place fossil fuels belong is stranded in the ground. And by rejecting the Williams Pipeline, New York is helping us END our fossil fuel dependency. This is a BIG win.
93	2020-05-16 14:48:19+00:00	Chirlane and I both come from military families. We grew up knowing what a difference our men and women in uniform make. In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic the world is seeing it firsthand. This #ArmedForcesDay we thank all those who serve our country — and our city.
94	2020-05-16 14:17:03+00:00	What the heck is an antibody test? Where can you get one and how reliable is it? Get the answers here — and then get your test at http://nyc.gov/antibodysurvey. Keep your questions coming, New York City. Join the conversation using the hashtag #AskMyMayor.
95	2020-05-16 00:53:00+00:00	If you’re looking for heroes, look no further than the team at @NYCHealthSystem-Queens in Jamaica. Thank you to every single one of our frontline health care workers for all you do. Thank you for saving lives. #ClapBecauseWeCare
96	2020-05-15 23:55:02+00:00	New York City, we have a blood shortage and the @NYBloodCenter needs YOU. It’s safe, it’s easy. Donate now and save a life. Head to http://nybc.org/donate-blood/ for more.
97	2020-05-15 19:00:36+00:00	We WILL revive arts and culture in our city. It will be different for a while, but I know we will come back strong. It was a hopeful, positive meeting with the Arts and Culture Council and there is a real devotion to coming back better than ever. That should give us all hope.
98	2020-05-15 19:00:36+00:00	I met with the Arts and Culture Council. They do amazing work and have a huge impact. We want them to come back but it will take time. Together we can find solutions, new ideas and plans forward. The councils are doing exactly what we want and they’re doing it to help us all.
99	2020-05-15 18:42:36+00:00	We want to focus on educating and encouraging New Yorkers to do their part when it comes to social distancing and face coverings. We need to strike a balance and I believe this is the right way for us to move forward.
100	2020-05-15 18:42:35+00:00	Our civilian agencies will work to educate New Yorkers on the importance of social distancing and face coverings, alongside houses of worship and community groups. The NYPD will not enforce failure to wear face coverings unless there is serious danger to the public.
101	2020-05-15 18:42:35+00:00	Big gatherings are a clear threat to our safety. The NYPD will continue to enforce the ban on gatherings, focusing on dispersing groups of six or more adults.
102	2020-05-15 18:42:35+00:00	Over the last six years, we’ve changed the relationship between the NYPD and the community. We CANNOT slide backwards. We will have a reset when it comes to COVID-19 enforcement.
103	2020-05-15 18:15:28+00:00	Parents and caregivers — if you see warning signs IMMEDIATELY reach out to a doctor or call 311. Be on high alert for persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting.
104	2020-05-15 18:15:28+00:00	We MUST protect our kids from something new we’re seeing — Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome. We have 110 patients reported. We’ve lost one child. We have to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another.
105	2020-05-15 17:38:25+00:00	This summer will require us to think differently and watch out for each other. If the results of the last few weeks are any indication, we’ll make adjustments to help each other out and move forward together.
106	2020-05-15 17:38:25+00:00	We have 60 portable generators for deployment with 22 more on the way. They will be pre-set around the city just in case.
107	2020-05-15 17:38:25+00:00	We are getting ready now to prevent power outages this summer. Last summer we saw problems in the Flatbush network. Much of it has been replaced and updated. We have new protocols in place and ConEd and @nycemergencymgt will alert us at the slightest sign of a problem.
108	2020-05-15 17:38:24+00:00	Parks will have more misting oases and spray showers so New Yorkers can keep cool while still practicing social distancing. We’ll also still have a classic New York City option – fire hydrants. We will open some in a safe way that won’t undermine the @FDNY.
109	2020-05-15 17:38:24+00:00	We need to rethink cooling centers to ensure residents can cool off comfortably and safely. We will identify larger locations for seniors and vulnerable New Yorkers in high-risk, hard-hit communities. We will provide PPE and ensure social distancing is possible.
110	2020-05-15 17:38:24+00:00	A lot of New Yorkers don’t run the AC because they can’t afford their utility bill. We’re asking the State to double its commitment to low-income New Yorkers, giving people another $160 more to defray costs of cooling their home. This could get so many through the summer safely.
111	2020-05-15 17:38:24+00:00	We’re putting our seniors first. The City is buying 74,000 air conditioners for our low income seniors, and giving them out for FREE. Installations start next week so we can put them in place BEFORE the heat hits. We’ve never done anything like this before.
112	2020-05-15 17:38:24+00:00	Summer is around the corner. That means heat waves that can be dangerous, especially in the era of COVID-19. We’re taking steps now to keep New Yorkers safe.
113	2020-05-15 13:46:02+00:00	Join us at City Hall for a COVID-19 update.
114	2020-05-15 13:39:49+00:00	I've heard from a lot of New Yorkers who have recovered from COVID-19 and want to donate plasma to help others. If you have: -Tested positive for COVID-19 -Are in good health -Are over 18 years old You can learn more and sign up at: https://www.nybc.org/donate-blood/covid-19-and-blood-donation-copy/convalescent-plasma/
115	2020-05-14 22:08:44+00:00	We need to talk about domestic and gender-based violence — especially right now. I’m proud of @NYCFirstLady for hosting this important conversation.
116	2020-05-14 19:09:40+00:00	Tragically, our Asian American business owners have been suffering since the beginning of this year due to discrimination and bias. We’ll fight it when it rears its ugly head.
117	2020-05-14 19:09:40+00:00	We are battling not just a health care crisis but an economic one. Last night I spoke with leaders on the Small Business Advisory Council. Even on the backdrop of fear and anxiety, they have proposals and the can-do attitude to make it work. We have to find ways to support them.
118	2020-05-14 17:52:59+00:00	@NYCHealthy is focusing their weekly webinar on PMIS and we want as many providers as possible to join. They will also hold a special webinar for the pediatric ICUs as well. We need doctors to find every case and get every child the care they need.
119	2020-05-14 17:52:58+00:00	We’ve seen 100 cases of Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome, with 55 of those cases testing positive for COVID-19 or its antibodies. If your child has persistent rash, fever, abdominal pain or vomiting, call your doctor or 311. Early detection makes all the difference.
120	2020-05-14 17:13:47+00:00	We’re building out a test and trace capacity that will beat back this disease for the long-term. The pieces for widespread testing are coming together — except when it comes to the labs and the federal government. We need them both to step up.
121	2020-05-14 17:13:47+00:00	We’re STILL playing catch-up because the help we deserved from the federal government has not come. That won’t stop us. We’ll keep building up our local testing.
122	2020-05-14 17:13:47+00:00	Our goal was to hit 20,000 tests per day by May 25th. Now we want to BEAT that goal. We have 23 walk in sites through @NYCHealthSystem, five more sites with @onemedical and 12 new sites opening soon. If the federal government supports us with lab capacity, the sky’s the limit.
123	2020-05-14 17:13:47+00:00	TESTING is key. We’re broadening our guidance for who can get a test: -ANYONE with symptoms -ANYONE who has been in close contact with a positive case -ANYONE who works in nursing homes, shelters, adult care facilities Go to http://nyc.gov/covidtest to find a location.
124	2020-05-14 17:13:43+00:00	The strength of New Yorkers has been tested so many times. Have faith. We will not only overcome, but we will come back as a stronger, better city. NEVER bet against New Yorkers.
125	2020-05-14 13:43:15+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
126	2020-05-13 20:33:36+00:00	Thank YOU! The team at Flushing Hospital are the front line heroes we’re talking about and clapping for every day. It’s OUR honor to help you do the work of saving lives.
127	2020-05-13 19:20:12+00:00	I had the honor of calling together leaders of all faiths as part of our advisory council to hear their concerns and ideas. We’re working closely together to address the spiritual and material needs of people while also keeping them safe.
128	2020-05-13 18:27:47+00:00	Seats are still available. It’s not too late. If your child was born in 2016 go to http://myschools.nyc or call 311.
129	2020-05-13 18:27:46+00:00	It’s a big day for our littlest learners: 61,000 Pre-K offers have gone out, with 77% of families getting their top choice and 90% receiving one of their top three choices! We can’t wait for school to resume so we can see these programs bring the best out of our kids.
130	2020-05-13 17:46:12+00:00	Parents, look out for: -Persistent fever -Rash -Abdominal pain -Vomiting If your child is experiencing any of these, call a doctor immediately. If you don’t have a doctor, call 311. We’ll do whatever it takes to protect the children of New York City.
131	2020-05-13 17:46:11+00:00	We now have 82 cases of Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome. 53 of those children tested positive to COVID-19 or its antibodies. There’s a lot we don’t know. But we DO know that early treatment works.
132	2020-05-13 17:33:47+00:00	Beginning Thursday we’ll DOUBLE our Open Streets with 12 more miles for New Yorkers to enjoy safely. I want to thank all of our local partners and local NYPD precincts for helping us ensure residents can get some exercise while still practicing social distancing.
133	2020-05-13 17:04:06+00:00	Mr. President, I’ll just say this. Your hometown is looking to you. Cities and states across the country are looking to you. It’s not red or blue. It’s one America trying together to recover but we need you. Say the word and the Senate will follow, it’s as simple as that.
134	2020-05-13 17:04:05+00:00	THIS is the level of help we need. @SpeakerPelosi listened to what we’re going through and what other states are going through. She crafted a plan that spoke to that reality. @SenSchumer will champion it in the Senate. That’s the fight ahead.
135	2020-05-13 17:04:05+00:00	The plan also invests in the RIGHT priorities: -$10 billion increase nationally to SNAP benefits -$4 billion more for section 8 housing -Almost $16 billion in grants to keep mass transit running This ACTUALLY responds to the magnitude of the problems our nation is facing.
136	2020-05-13 17:04:04+00:00	The proposal offers $17 billion in direct aid to New York City and $34 billion in direct aid to the state of New York. This will ensure we can keep providing for our people and keep them safe. It will keep our city whole.
137	2020-05-13 17:04:02+00:00	The #HeroesAct lives up to this unprecedented moment in American history. Thank you @SpeakerPelosi, @NitaLowey, @RepJeffries, @RepJerryNadler, @NydiaVelazquez, @RepMaloney, @RepEliotEngel and our entire delegation for their leadership.
138	2020-05-13 17:04:01+00:00	We’re facing a crisis like nothing since the Great Depression. Half-measures won’t protect us. Finally, we’re seeing a stimulus plan in the House that speaks to the unprecedented health care and economic challenges our nation is facing.
139	2020-05-13 13:44:46+00:00	We’re at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
140	2020-05-13 02:52:21+00:00	The #HeroesAct is the perfect name — our city is full of heroes giving their all in the fight against COVID-19. Thank you to our House delegation for leading the way. Let’s get this done. You won’t have an American recovery without a New York City recovery.
141	2020-05-12 20:27:27+00:00	As challenging as the COVID-19 crisis has been, imagine how much harder it would be if not for our nurses. These heroes have always gone above and beyond — and now more than ever the world is recognizing their courage and sacrifice. #InternationalNursesDay
142	2020-05-12 19:47:13+00:00	The dedicated team at @ProjHospitality have been getting food to anyone who needs it on Staten Island. We’re proud to have teamed up with the @NYCCouncil to support their work. We won’t let ANY New Yorker go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis: http://nyc.gov/getfood
143	2020-05-12 17:42:58+00:00	Grace Bonilla will join our Equity and Racial Inclusion Task Force as its Executive Director. She’s been the administrator at @NYCHRA and has dedicated her life to helping vulnerable New Yorkers.
144	2020-05-12 17:42:58+00:00	It can’t be said enough: COVID-19 has forced us to confront some deadly disparities and we must address them ALL.
145	2020-05-12 16:17:02+00:00	If your child has a persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting CALL YOUR DOCTOR. If you don’t have a doctor, call 311.
146	2020-05-12 16:17:00+00:00	Since we put out our health alert, we’ve been getting more reports of cases of pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome related to COVID-19 in children. This is a major concern. Take this seriously.
147	2020-05-12 15:38:07+00:00	We have 535 prospective contact tracers in training. They’re undergoing the program set up by Johns Hopkins. We are gearing up to hire thousands more. If you have a health care background, go to http://nyc.gov/traceteam to apply. We need you.
148	2020-05-12 15:38:06+00:00	Today I’m announcing 12 new community testing sites opening over the next 3 weeks. Thousands more New Yorkers will be able to get a test in their own neighborhood.
149	2020-05-12 15:38:06+00:00	Testing is a DECISIVE tool we need to fight this disease. It’s what we needed from day one — and DIDN’T get from the federal government. We’re doing everything we can to expand rapidly ourselves so we can beat back this disease.
150	2020-05-12 15:38:06+00:00	Social distancing isn’t easy. Sheltering in place isn’t easy. Wearing a face covering isn’t easy. But you’ve done it, New York City. You’re the reason we have the chance to go on the offensive against COVID-19.
151	2020-05-12 13:44:46+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
152	2020-05-11 21:00:00+00:00	I want you to meet Nancy Reynoso. Before the pandemic, she served our city as taxi driver. Now she’s joined the ranks of our heroes, transporting food to our neighbors in need.
153	2020-05-11 19:55:22+00:00	More good news: Last night outreach workers engaged 261 unsheltered New Yorkers when the subway shut down. 139 accepted help.
154	2020-05-11 19:55:21+00:00	We had a goal of moving 1,000 unsheltered residents per week into hotels to open up shelters. We met that goal last week. We’ll meet it again this week. There are now more than 8,000 previously unsheltered adults in hotels. That’s nearly HALF of our single adult population.
155	2020-05-11 18:20:01+00:00	EVERY New Yorker could relate when Jerry Stiller shouted “SERENITY NOW!” This son of Brooklyn brought the humor of everyday New Yorkers to the world. On behalf of his hometown I offer our deepest condolences to all who knew and loved him.
156	2020-05-11 17:58:44+00:00	Jonnel Doris will take over as @NYC_SBS Commissioner. He’s spent years championing minority and women owned businesses — he’s the right choice to do the work of bringing back our small businesses with new resources and new help.
157	2020-05-11 17:58:43+00:00	@NYC_SBS Commissioner Gregg Bishop will become my new Senior Advisor For Small Business COVID-19 Recovery. He’ll be tasked with finding new resources for our small businesses. Gregg has been a tireless advocate for the small business community. He’s ready to lead this fight.
158	2020-05-11 17:58:43+00:00	Small businesses are the cornerstones of our neighborhoods AND our city. If they don’t come back, we don’t come back. Our emergency loan and grant program was a start but there is so much more to do — and we need the federal government to step up.
159	2020-05-11 17:23:19+00:00	This anti-Semitic attack is unacceptable in EVERY way. I commend the NYPD for ensuring the perpetrators were arrested quickly. We have ZERO tolerance for this kind of reckless hatred in New York City.
160	2020-05-11 16:14:58+00:00	@nycHealthy has been training our community clinics in telemedicine and wellness checks, giving them the tools to reach our most vulnerable New Yorkers across all five boroughs. This isn’t just about the pandemic. We’re strengthening community based providers for years to come.
161	2020-05-11 16:14:58+00:00	More than 1,000 community based providers will get 120,000 masks and 150,000 gloves each week. We'll also get them personnel from the Medical Reserve Corps — at no cost to them.
162	2020-05-11 16:14:58+00:00	COVID-19 has laid bare some unacceptable disparities in our society — and laid a challenge to our city: we won’t just save lives, we’ll END these disparities. We’ll reach the hardest hit communities in this pandemic by supporting our community health care clinics and practices.
163	2020-05-11 15:33:55+00:00	ALTERNATE SIDE PARKING UPDATE: ASP will be SUSPENDED through May 17. It will RESUME May 18-24 to do a week long cleaning sweep of the city. We will then SUSPEND Alternate Side Parking from May 25-June 7.
164	2020-05-11 13:41:55+00:00	Join me at City Hall for a COVID-19 update.
165	2020-05-10 20:15:26+00:00	Let’s take a moment this #MothersDay to think of all our moms who are doctors, nurses, EMTs, paramedics, police officers, teachers, correction officers and ALL the essential workers who have kept our city running during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you!
166	2020-05-10 19:53:19+00:00	This team of public servants will be tasked with educating New Yorkers on the importance of social distancing and distributing masks for free all across the city.
167	2020-05-10 19:53:19+00:00	The vast majority of our city is taking social distancing seriously — but we need to go even further to save lives. That’s where our social distancing ambassadors come in.
168	2020-05-10 19:27:41+00:00	We’re not stopping there. We are fighting for benefits for the families of public servants we’ve lost in the next stimulus bill. It’s time for Washington to step up.
169	2020-05-10 19:27:40+00:00	We’ve lost at least 260 dedicated public servants to COVID-19. Today we’re keeping their loved ones in our thoughts — and announcing that we will extend health insurance for their families. We will serve these families the way their loved ones served our city.
170	2020-05-10 19:06:03+00:00	We again need Washington to act: more than half a million doses are in federal control. Only 4,000 doses have been provided to @NYCHealthSystem. We need at least 39,000 doses for the month of May. The hardest hit places should get the most help.
171	2020-05-10 19:06:03+00:00	This week the FDA approved the use of Remdesivir to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients. The initial clinical trials shows it decreased hospital stays from 15 to 11 days. That’s promising.
172	2020-05-10 18:41:27+00:00	To every parent out there: early detection is the key to fighting this. It can be treated. If you see these symptoms, take them seriously and act immediately. Call 311 if you don‘t have a doctor.
173	2020-05-10 18:41:27+00:00	@NYCHealthSystem will be testing any kids with symptoms for antibodies. We’re sending a health alert to all public school parents, and instructing regional enrichment centers to increase enforcement of face coverings, masks and hand sanitizer.
174	2020-05-10 18:41:26+00:00	I’m heartbroken to report that we’ve lost one child to this condition. On behalf of our city I want to express our condolences to that child’s family.
175	2020-05-10 18:41:26+00:00	If your child is experiencing fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting please contact your doctor right away. So far we’ve seen 38 cases. 47% of the kids tested positive for COVID-19. Of those who tested negative, 81% had the antibody.
176	2020-05-10 18:41:25+00:00	This disease is challenging. We keeping learning more about it every day. This week we discussed a rare pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome that started to emerge. We are taking new steps to protect kids from it.
177	2020-05-10 15:35:27+00:00	Happy #MothersDay, New York City! As you shower all the moms and mother figures in your life with love today, remember the greatest gift you can give this year is keeping them safe and healthy.
178	2020-05-10 13:44:02+00:00	I’m at City Hall with a COVID-19 update.
179	2020-05-09 17:38:08+00:00	С днём победы! #VictoryinEuropeDay
180	2020-05-09 13:29:09+00:00	The next great heroes in the COVID-19 fight are stepping up. If you have a health care background, join the Test and Trace Corps. Apply at http://nyc.gov/traceteam. Join the conversation and send us your COVID-19 questions using the hashtag #AskMyMayor.
181	2020-05-09 00:23:21+00:00	Earlier today I said we were winning the COVID-19 fight. We’re winning because of health care heroes like the team at @NYCHealthSystem Metropolitan in Manhattan. And we need to keep doing everything we can to support them so they can win this fight for good. #ClapBecauseWeCare
182	2020-05-08 22:06:39+00:00	75 years after #VictoryInEuropeDay we must acknowledge the painful truth that anti-Semitism remains a plague on our society — and we owe it to the veterans who won World War Two and to the survivors of the Holocaust who call our city home to defeat it once and for all.
183	2020-05-08 17:16:13+00:00	Over the last three nights, more than half of the unsheltered residents we’ve engaged on subways have accepted help. That’s a remarkable success rate. Thank you to everyone involved at @NYCDHS, social services and our nonprofit partners. They are unsung heroes.
184	2020-05-08 16:30:17+00:00	We’re seeing consistent overcrowding in a few parks. It’s not acceptable and we’re taking action to save lives. We will be limiting the number of people in several parks, including Hudson River Park, Piers 45 and 46 and we’ll have extra enforcement at Domino Park.
185	2020-05-08 15:45:25+00:00	Testing and tracing WORKS. Paired with the progress we’ve already made, this is the push we need to beat back this disease. We’ll get it right and we’ll take steps to start reopening.
186	2020-05-08 15:45:25+00:00	We're partnering with Salesforce to launch a call center and case management system to support our test and tracing efforts. We’re readying 1,200 hotel rooms for those who cannot self-isolate at home, with the food, medical care and laundry services they’ll need.
187	2020-05-08 15:45:25+00:00	The Corps is preparing for 20,000 tests a day and more than 30 community testing sites in just the next few weeks — and we will increase that many times over.
188	2020-05-08 15:45:25+00:00	The Test and Trace Corps will test New Yorkers for infection, trace all cases and contacts and provide support and care for those who test positive. The Corps will bring on 2,500 public health employees by June to investigate, trace and manage case data.
189	2020-05-08 15:45:25+00:00	Today I announced the New York City Test and Trace Corps. They will lead the way in creating testing and tracing on a level we’ve never seen before in this city or country. This is a call to arms.
190	2020-05-08 15:45:24+00:00	Throughout this crisis we have NOT had the testing we needed or deserved. Thank God @SpeakerPelosi and the House are fighting for MORE testing resources. We need federal leadership, but in the meantime we’ll use every tool we have to maximize testing here.
191	2020-05-08 15:45:24+00:00	When it comes to our indicators, the big picture is unquestionably good but we are STILL not where we need to be. Hospital and ICU admissions are up slightly. The proportion of positive tests are down. We have more work to do.
192	2020-05-08 15:45:24+00:00	We’re winning the COVID-19 fight — but it’s far from over. It’s not the time to relax, it’s time to double down and make sure we KEEP winning. We’re going on the offensive and looking for new tools and new ways of fighting back against this disease.
193	2020-05-08 13:41:53+00:00	Join us for an update on COVID-19.
194	2020-05-08 02:17:18+00:00	Saving lives in this pandemic is job one. The NYPD uses summonses and arrests to do it. Most people practice social distancing, with only hundreds of summonses issued over 6 weeks. But the disparity in the numbers does NOT reflect our values. We HAVE TO do better and we WILL.
195	2020-05-07 23:00:07+00:00	We’ve made real progress in the COVID-19 battle, but we haven’t won the war yet. But thanks to frontline heroes like the team at Interfaith Medical in Brooklyn I’m confident we’ll overcome this crisis. #ClapBecauseWeCare
196	2020-05-07 21:04:14+00:00	Our @NYCSchools teachers have done the extraordinary in just a few weeks time, creating a new educational system for the the largest school system in America. We literally couldn’t get through the COVID-19 crisis without them. #TeacherAppreciationWeek
197	2020-05-07 20:43:39+00:00	Last night more than half of the homeless New Yorkers we engaged on the subways accepted help. Think about that. Think about the lives that have been changed from this extraordinary work. This could lead to a new approach.
198	2020-05-07 19:44:53+00:00	Tele-health and tele-visits are allowing us to reach New Yorkers who have NEVER had care before — and we're doing it quickly and efficiently. When our city comes back, we’ll continue tele-health and be fairer than ever before.
199	2020-05-07 19:44:52+00:00	So far @NYCHealthSystem has conducted 60,000 appointment based tele-visits at more than 300 Health + Hospital clinics across the city. Our goal is to ramp up to 16,000 tele-visits a week starting in June. This would make up 80% of outpatient visits.
200	2020-05-07 19:44:50+00:00	Tele-medicine is saving lives. We need to fight inequalities and expand it to make sure EVERY community has access to it. If you’re having symptoms and have nowhere to turn, call 844-NYC-4NYC. Help is available.
201	2020-05-07 18:18:57+00:00	Today I’m launching the COVID-19 Task Force on Domestic and Gender-Based Violence to provide shelter, housing and mental health support for anyone who needs it. No one should suffer at home or suffer in silence — and no one should be afraid in a place that should be safe.
202	2020-05-07 18:18:56+00:00	The painful reality is that home is not a safe place for some of our neighbors. We’ve seen troubling trends when it comes to domestic and gender-based violence. Help is available at a moments notice. You’ll get shelter, no questions asked. Call 800-621-4673.
203	2020-05-07 17:44:19+00:00	We had NO federal help with testing early on. That could have helped us track the spread across communities and learn which jobs and demographics were hardest hit. We’ll get the answers on our own, fighting this disease in a smarter way.
204	2020-05-07 17:44:19+00:00	Starting next week we will offer antibody tests at sites in five neighborhoods: Morrisania, East New York, Concord, Upper Manhattan, and Long Island City. We’ll perform 70,000 in May and 70,000 in June.
205	2020-05-07 17:44:19+00:00	We’re announcing 140,000 MORE for New Yorkers in partnership with BioReference. We will perform 280,000 antibody tests in the coming weeks and months.
206	2020-05-07 17:44:17+00:00	We already announced 140,000 antibody tests for health care workers and first responders from our partnership with the CDC and Health and Human Services. That testing starts next week.
207	2020-05-07 17:44:17+00:00	Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests tell you whether you have the disease right now. The antibody test tells you if you’ve previously been exposed AND helps us understand how to beat this disease. We’re going to build up antibody testing alongside our PCR testing capacity.
208	2020-05-07 17:44:13+00:00	There’s so much uncertainty when it comes to COVID-19. The lack of testing from the federal government has been THE problem. In New York City we are DONE letting the federal government drop the ball. Every day more New Yorkers are getting tested. It’s the key to moving forward.
209	2020-05-07 16:59:35+00:00	Cities across the planet aren’t waiting to take action. Working with @c40cities we’ve laid out resiliency policies and a plan for an economy focused on green jobs, reducing pollution and emissions and making sure everyone gets their fair share. We need this on a global scale.
210	2020-05-07 16:59:33+00:00	COVID-19 has proven that we MUST come together around the world to address the dangers to health and safety from climate change. We’re living through what happens when our country isn’t prepared. If we don’t work together, global warming will overtake us.
211	2020-05-07 16:39:21+00:00	Now’s the time to go even further. Tenants are hurting. We need to let every New Yorker who needs it to be able to defer rent payments for up to 12 months.
212	2020-05-07 16:38:33+00:00	YES! Yes! Yes! Yes! From putting security deposits towards rent to expanding eviction bans, we’ve been pushing Albany to take bold action for tenants. Thank you @NYGovCuomo for heeding the call.
213	2020-05-07 15:58:58+00:00	We’re all in this together, @rubendiazjr — when the Bronx is strong, New York City is strong.
214	2020-05-07 13:43:14+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
215	2020-05-07 00:12:42+00:00	More than 70 thousand people are dead from COVID-19. More than a million are infected. Even more have lost their jobs. And @realDonaldTrump’s plan? “Terminate” health care for millions of Americans.
216	2020-05-06 21:33:11+00:00	When you stop and think about what our nurses have done throughout this crisis — it’s just remarkable. New York City will never forget what they’ve done to save lives. We applaud them on #NationalNursesDay — and every day. #ThankYouNurses
217	2020-05-06 18:19:16+00:00	This virus exploits our weaknesses. We cannot allow it to resurface. Let’s handle this restart correctly. Take a step, get it right and move forward together, and remember that keyword: moderation.
218	2020-05-06 18:19:16+00:00	We are also building up our distribution of free face masks, getting 7.5 million face coverings to the New Yorkers who need them. We’ll be out in parks and public spaces across the city. Go to http://nyc.gov/facecoverings to find one near you.
219	2020-05-06 18:19:16+00:00	Over the last few days, we’ve opened 7 miles of #OpenStreets and we’re opening more tomorrow. They’ll reach neighborhoods from the Lower East Side to Jackson Heights where open space is hard to come by.
220	2020-05-06 18:19:15+00:00	We’re convening Sector Advisory Councils to give real-world input on how policies will play out on the ground. They’ll focus on small businesses, labor, tourism and more. We want ideas from every corner of our city and the people who know their industries and communities best.
221	2020-05-06 18:19:15+00:00	How do we restart? One simple word: MODERATION. There’s no on/off switch. Our restart will happen gradually and in stages. We CANNOT rush this, or lives will be put at risk.
222	2020-05-06 17:43:35+00:00	If you or someone you know needs shelter, please reach out. Call 311. Our outreach teams are ready to help bring people home
223	2020-05-06 17:43:35+00:00	That much success in one single night’s work is unprecedented. 139 of our unsheltered residents took a step towards something better. We have to sustain it and we have a lot of work to do, but this is a promising start.
224	2020-05-06 17:43:34+00:00	Last night the MTA closed the subways for deep cleaning. Our homeless outreach teams were out in force. More than half of the unsheltered residents engaged by our teams agreed to accept support and services, from a warm bed to medical treatment. This is extraordinary work.
225	2020-05-06 14:16:21+00:00	I’m at City Hall with a COVID-19 update.
226	2020-05-05 22:12:34+00:00	Finally you said the quiet part out loud! I’m no doctor but I know cutting the Capital Gains Tax won’t cure the coronavirus.
227	2020-05-05 21:49:26+00:00	Happy #CincoDeMayo! Though we may not be able to celebrate together in person this year, I know the courage and resilience of our Mexican community lives in the heart of every New Yorker.
228	2020-05-05 20:48:43+00:00	Talk about unsung heroes. In the midst of this pandemic the women and men who keep our buildings running have a stood even taller. On behalf of the city they serve, I #ThankEssentialBuildingWorkers today!
229	2020-05-05 19:33:40+00:00	Free distribution of face coverings is off to a BIG start — and now we’re expanding it even further. We’re giving out MILLIONS more for FREE across the five boroughs. Help protect your city. Head to http://nyc.gov/facecoverings for times and locations.
230	2020-05-05 18:40:31+00:00	We're already seeing results. Peak wait times for 311 are now down 75% from early in April. We’ll keep getting better and ensure New Yorkers have the help and support they need.
231	2020-05-05 18:40:31+00:00	"We’ve also launched ""Express Lanes"" for the most urgent questions. Concerns about food or COVID-19 symptoms come FIRST — and we’re getting the answers quickly, in English AND Spanish."
232	2020-05-05 18:40:31+00:00	We've hired 285 call-takers in the past two weeks, stationed across 4 new call centers. This includes: 150 NYPD cadets 120 Temporary hires, 65% who speak Spanish 15 FDNY employees We brought in experts to address today’s challenges AND head off future emergencies.
233	2020-05-05 18:40:30+00:00	The team at 311 has been working around the clock to keep New Yorkers informed during this crisis and today we announced a 3-part action plan that’s helping us do even more.
234	2020-05-05 17:22:52+00:00	If your child is experiencing a persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain or vomiting, call your doctor right away. @nycHealthy has instructed all New York City health care providers to report any patients under 21 years old with these symptoms IMMEDIATELY.
235	2020-05-05 17:22:52+00:00	We haven’t seen any fatalities yet, but we are very concerned by what we’re seeing. We’re learning more every day about how COVID-19 affects the body. This is a ferocious disease.
236	2020-05-05 17:22:52+00:00	We have an urgent health alert for parents and doctors. We’ve detected 15 cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome detected in children in NYC hospitals. 4 patients tested positive for COVID-19 while 6 others had antibodies.
237	2020-05-05 16:40:45+00:00	We only ask that people in Washington show a little respect for the people of our city, who’ve borne the brunt of this crisis and have lived in the epicenter of a national dilemma. Anyone with a heart and soul would show respect and appreciation for the people of New York City.
238	2020-05-05 16:40:45+00:00	The President of the United States, a former New Yorker who seems to enjoy stabbing his hometown in the back, talking about no bailout for New York. What kind of human being sees the suffering here and decides the people in New York City don’t deserve help?
239	2020-05-05 16:40:44+00:00	.@realDonaldTrump told the @NYPost he doesn’t think his home state and hometown need bailouts. This is the same president who just weeks ago bailed out the airlines to the tune of $58 billion.
240	2020-05-05 13:42:52+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
241	2020-05-04 22:14:03+00:00	Stepping up for New Yorkers? Nike Just Did It! Thank you so much for supporting our front line health care heroes and the @NYCMayorsFund.
242	2020-05-04 21:02:20+00:00	New York’s Best and Bravest serve us every day — it was our honor to serve them today. And thank you to Harold’s Restaurant for helping us deliver a lunch fit for the @FDNY. #InternationalFirefightersDay
243	2020-05-04 19:56:52+00:00	In the last few weeks our @NYCSchools teachers have done something unprecedented and created remote learning for 1.1 million kids — the largest school district in America. This #TeacherAppreciationWeek we are grateful to the best educators in the world. #ThankATeacherNYC
244	2020-05-04 19:28:38+00:00	In the dark of night when a siren rings, New Yorkers know that means our Bravest and Best are running towards the danger. This year on #InternationalFirefightersDay, our @FDNY Firefighters, EMTs and Paramedics are going above and beyond to save lives. Thank you for all you do.
245	2020-05-04 18:25:07+00:00	Thank you @SenSchumer, @SenGillibrand, @RepEliotEngel, @RepTomSuozzi, @RepGregoryMeeks, @Grace4NY, @NydiaVelazquez, @RepJeffries, @RepYvetteClarke, @RepJerryNadler, @RepMaxRose, @RepMaloney, @RepEspaillat, @RepAOC and @RepJoseSerrano.
246	2020-05-04 18:25:06+00:00	From day one of this crisis, we’ve been able to count on our delegation to lead the charge in Washington. They’ve gone to the mat for our city. Lives have been saved because of their work.
247	2020-05-04 18:25:06+00:00	Anyone who says we don’t need a fourth stimulus should come to New York City and see this battle first hand. If you want a real recovery, you need our city up and running — and I want to thank our congressional delegation for fighting tirelessly to get us the support we need.
248	2020-05-04 17:27:12+00:00	I ask you to keep thinking about our health care workers. Every day they walk through those hospital doors because they believe in saving lives. Let’s help them by sheltering in place, social distancing and wearing face coverings. Let’s keep winning and protecting our heroes.
249	2020-05-04 17:27:11+00:00	New York City is also providing free iPads to non-public school students with disabilities. We’ll do everything we can to keep them connected. Call 311 or visit http://schools.nyc.gov to request a device today.
250	2020-05-04 17:27:11+00:00	In the middle of a crisis, something good happened. We’ve delivered WiFi-enabled iPad’s to all the public school students who requested one. That’s 250,000! They’re still available, call 311 if your child needs one. We’ll get it to you right away.
251	2020-05-04 17:27:10+00:00	We’re building up our distribution of free face coverings to a much higher level. Starting immediately we will distribute 7.5 million face coverings — 5 million non-medical masks and 2.5 million washable cloth face coverings. Look out for them in parks, meal sites and stores.
252	2020-05-04 17:27:10+00:00	An important piece of the puzzle are face coverings. Overwhelmingly, New Yorkers are wearing them. Think of it this way: every time you wear a face covering, you’re reducing the spread of this disease and taking one small step toward normalcy. Keeping going.
253	2020-05-04 17:27:10+00:00	We are starting an NYC Strategic Reserve to ensure we have the capacity to buy and build the things we need to protect our health care workers right here at home. We will build a 90 day stock pile of PPEs and crucial equipment to keep our people safe.
254	2020-05-04 17:27:10+00:00	We’re looking out for nursing homes too. We MUST strengthen and protect them. This week we’re sending them: 1,930,000 Surgical Masks 170,000 Face shields 767,000 Gloves 173,000 Gowns 15,000 Coveralls and Aprons 10,000 Shoe coverings
255	2020-05-04 17:27:10+00:00	We finally have some breathing room when it comes to PPE. For the first time since March, we’re starting a week with a sufficient supply of protective gear at crisis standards. That’s a striking statement in the largest city in the country, in the greatest country in the world.
256	2020-05-04 17:27:09+00:00	We CANNOT let the warmer weather fool us into thinking we’re returning to normal. Public hospital ICUs are still at DOUBLE their normal capacity. Every day people are coming into our hospitals and fighting for their lives. We cannot let up now.
257	2020-05-04 13:41:54+00:00	We’re at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
258	2020-05-03 23:19:55+00:00	Saw the video from the Lower East Side and was really disturbed by it. The officer involved has been placed on modified duty and an investigation has begun. The behavior I saw in that video is simply not acceptable.
259	2020-05-03 20:02:05+00:00	The vast majority of New Yorkers are sticking to social distancing. But some are not getting the point, as we’ve seen this weekend in Hudson River Park. I have instructed the NYPD to increase enforcement in that park. Anyone who ignores instructions by an officer gets a summons.
260	2020-05-03 18:53:44+00:00	New Yorkers think of Puerto Rico as our sixth borough. We’re keeping our neighbors in our thoughts today. Our fellow Americans who call that beautiful island home have been through so much these past few years. Yesterday’s earthquake must not be ignored.
261	2020-05-03 16:50:36+00:00	We have another day of warm weather ahead of us. Don’t give up on the progress we’ve made together, New York City. Keep social distancing. Keep covering your face. Be smart. Be safe.
262	2020-05-03 16:50:36+00:00	Food remains a major concern for New Yorkers. Our goal? We want the ability to deliver 1 MILLION meals a day. But we need community groups who know their neighborhoods best to help us get there. Go to http://nyc.gov/nonprofits for more.
263	2020-05-03 16:50:36+00:00	More than a thousand of our @NYCHealthSystem staff are working around the clock, just like their colleagues at the @NYCHealthy Public Health Lab. They're pushing boundaries, developing new techniques — and saving lives.
264	2020-05-03 16:50:36+00:00	I also want to thank our lab workers. I had the chance to meet with some of them yesterday in Brooklyn.
265	2020-05-03 16:50:36+00:00	I want to thank local partner Print Parts and the Bronx's own Albert Einstein College of Medicine for helping us get NYC-made test kits into hospitals as quickly as possible.
266	2020-05-03 16:50:35+00:00	In New York City we make things happen — and the COVID-19 crisis hasn't changed that. We're making our own testing kits here in the five boroughs — we're on track to produce 50,000 3D printed swaps per week with the first 30,000 to be delivered this week.
267	2020-05-03 16:50:35+00:00	It’s natural to look at the improving numbers and wonder: “Why can’t we go back to normal?” One ugly word standing in our way: BOOMERANG. This is a ferocious disease. It’s not going to go quietly. And if we let up now, it will come back.
268	2020-05-03 16:50:35+00:00	New Yorkers have so much to be proud of over the past couple of weeks. The key numbers we watch for progress every day are trending down. You’ve written that story and helped save lives.
269	2020-05-03 13:43:59+00:00	Join us for an update on COVID-19.
270	2020-05-02 13:03:08+00:00	You asked, and we delivered: Cupid is coming to New York City this week. On Thursday, May 7, you'll be able to get your marriage license online at http://nyc.gov/cupid. What other COVID-19 questions do you have? Join the conversation with the hashtag #AskMyMayor.
271	2020-05-02 00:36:00+00:00	Our Asian and Pacific Islander communities have contributed so much to the fabric of our city. Now more than ever we must let them know that we stand with them — and AGAINST the discrimination we’ve seen in this crisis. New York City is and will always be your home. #APAHM
272	2020-05-02 00:01:18+00:00	BREAKING NEWS: #OpenStreets are starting early! Thanks to quick work by the @NYC_DOT, @NYCParks and @NYPDNews, we’re going to open up the first 7 miles of streets for pedestrians and cyclists SATURDAY. PLEASE practice social distancing and stay safe.
273	2020-05-01 21:30:21+00:00	Who’s taking care of the sick, stocking the shelves and keeping our city moving during the COVID-19 pandemic? Not the 1 percent. It’s working people. The working class is standing tall and holding our country together — like it always does in a crisis. #InternationalWorkersDay
274	2020-05-01 20:48:14+00:00	If you or someone you know needs to talk to somebody, reach out. Call 1-888-NYC-Well or visit http://nyc.gov/ThriveNYC. Help is standing by.
275	2020-05-01 20:46:39+00:00	We don’t speak enough about mental health, not just in our city but in our country and our world. It shouldn’t be this way. Now more than ever we need to reject the stigma around mental health and remind everyone struggling that they are not alone. #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth
276	2020-05-01 17:09:01+00:00	We are winning this fight a little more every day, but we have not yet won. States that open prematurely are not being “liberated.” They’re damning people, potentially to their deaths. We won’t allow that in New York City. When we come back, we will come back safely.
277	2020-05-01 17:09:01+00:00	I don’t want you to separate your actions from the people around you. I want you to take it personally. If we do what we’re capable of doing, we can save lives. Every time we don't, we give this virus a chance to make a comeback. We can’t let that happen.
278	2020-05-01 17:09:00+00:00	Our open streets initiative is another way we’ll encourage social distancing. We’ll open 40 miles in May and up to 100 miles overall. The first streets will open on Monday, creating 7 miles of car-free space.
279	2020-05-01 17:09:00+00:00	In May we’ll have stronger enforcement efforts, we’ll pass out free face coverings and we’ll use all the tools we have to assertively make progress. We have the chance to do something transcendent when it comes to testing and tracing.
280	2020-05-01 17:09:00+00:00	The indicators reflect action. When social distancing is honored, it has a huge impact. Most New Yorkers are doing that. But we’ve seen unfortunate examples where it hasn’t been followed. We can’t tolerate that. Call 311 immediately if you see groups gathering.
281	2020-05-01 17:09:00+00:00	We’re seeing progress today in the proportion of people tested who are positive. It went down citywide and in our public health lab over the last week. This is certainly decelerating but we are NOT out of the woods.
282	2020-05-01 17:09:00+00:00	Our public hospitals still feel the strain. Right now there are almost 700 military personnel in our hospitals and we need them. If we open up, we risk going back to a place where we again exceed capacity and need field hospitals.
283	2020-05-01 17:09:00+00:00	The number of people admitted to hospitals each day with suspected COVID-19 has dropped substantially. That’s a very good thing. But the number of people in our public hospitals ICUs remains persistently high.
284	2020-05-01 17:08:59+00:00	Yesterday we saw 2,637 confirmed new cases of Coronavirus in the five boroughs. That is a huge number. We lost 202 New Yorkers. Each of them is a human being. A family member, a friend, a neighbor. A fellow New Yorker. The numbers like this tell us there's still a fight ahead.
285	2020-05-01 17:08:59+00:00	May can be a turning point in the COVID-19 fight — but only if New Yorkers continue to be tough and disciplined. We CANNOT let up now.
286	2020-05-01 13:47:49+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
287	2020-04-30 22:37:29+00:00	In just a few weeks, most New Yorkers have gotten into the habit of wearing face coverings. Thank you for stepping up. If we’re asking you to wear face coverings, then we’re going to do our part to make it easier for you to get them. Go to http://nyc.gov/facecoverings for more.
288	2020-04-30 21:35:20+00:00	Integrity first, service before self. That’s the heart of the @USAirForce’s mission. Thank you to General Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy and his team for joining our frontline heroes at New York City’s public hospitals during this crisis.
289	2020-04-30 19:28:09+00:00	We’ll have more than a thousand City employees out in parks and public spaces dedicated to keeping people safe and socially-distanced. They’ll distribute more face coverings as well.
290	2020-04-30 19:28:08+00:00	We’re asking New Yorkers to wear face coverings — and we’re doing our part to make it easier for you to get them. We’ll pass out thousands this week at parks and in hard-hit communities. Go to http://nyc.gov/facecoverings to find a location where you can get a free face covering.
291	2020-04-30 19:28:08+00:00	In just a few weeks, most New Yorkers have gotten into the habit of wearing face coverings. Thank you for stepping up. As a reminder: If you don’t wear a face covering, you’re putting people at risk. Store managers have the right to tell you to leave if you don't wear one.
292	2020-04-30 18:08:59+00:00	Over these last few weeks, I’ve watched us fight back with incredible strength and compassion. One way or another, we will find a way. We’ll find more testing, tracing and supplies. We’ll restart our city and come back stronger, fairer and better. I have absolute faith in that.
293	2020-04-30 18:08:59+00:00	We will go from 11 to 30 testing sites by mid-May. The self-swab tests will speed things up and we’re working with labs to get more capacity. We’ll be able to reach 43,000 tests per week at community sites by the week of May 18th. We NEED federal help to go farther.
294	2020-04-30 18:08:59+00:00	Visit http://nychealthandhospitals.org for more information on testing.
295	2020-04-30 18:08:58+00:00	We are adding two more community testing sites at @NYCHealthSystem clinics in Coney Island and Inwood. Starting next week we’ll also provide community testing at a larger scale at ALL hospital sites, with a priority on the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.
296	2020-04-30 18:08:58+00:00	We now have 8 @NYCHealthSystem community testing sites up and running and 3 testing sites at NYCHA locations that are OPEN. Those locations are at the Jonathan Williams Houses in Williamsburg, Woodside Houses in Woodside and St. Nicholas Houses in Harlem.
297	2020-04-30 18:08:58+00:00	Testing has been the central issue throughout this crisis. For so long it was very limited and focused on saving lives in the hospital. In recent weeks, we’ve finally gotten the testing capacity, personnel and PPEs to go out into the city and do wider community testing.
298	2020-04-30 18:08:57+00:00	This is the first time in quite a while we can say we have a secure supply of surgical gowns for the weeks ahead. Thank you everyone at @NYCEDC for this HUGE accomplishment.
299	2020-04-30 18:08:57+00:00	1 MILLION gowns are now on their way. Another million will come next week. And 3 million more are in production. We’re shipping the fabric to make even more. We’ll now have enough gowns to get to the middle of May.
300	2020-04-30 18:08:57+00:00	We’re now making 125,000 surgical gowns a week right here in New York City. But we need a LOT more. Our friends at BCI Brands have a sister factory in Vietnam capable of massive production — and thanks to Viet Thanh Garments, we now have a large-scale gown provider.
301	2020-04-30 18:08:57+00:00	New Yorkers always find a way in the face of impossible odds. We’ve proven it time and again in the COVID-19 crisis. And to overcome a shortage of critical supplies like surgical gowns for our health care heroes, we’re about to do it again.
302	2020-04-30 17:57:47+00:00	The Rent Guidelines Board just reviewed the Income & Affordability report and their new data includes some staggering news: we’ve had a nearly 2000% increase in unemployment filings during this crisis. Two thousand! It’s never been clearer: we need a rent freeze NOW.
303	2020-04-30 17:26:58+00:00	We’re all in this together, Governor. This won’t be easy, but it’s the right thing to do to protect our essential workers. We’ve seen throughout the COVID-19 crisis, nobody meets a challenge better than New Yorkers.
304	2020-04-30 16:09:03+00:00	I’m with @NYGovCuomo with more updates on COVID-19. Tune in:
305	2020-04-30 13:44:56+00:00	Join me at City Hall for the latest on COVID-19.
306	2020-04-29 23:24:57+00:00	If you have any information on this vicious attack please contact the NYPD IMMEDIATELY. This kind of loathsome hate has no home in our city.
307	2020-04-29 21:13:34+00:00	On #YomHaatzmaut we pause to recognize a country and a people whose strength and perseverance in the face of adversity, hatred and evil are an inspiration to all of us. To all who celebrate: Happy Israeli Independence Day.
308	2020-04-29 19:18:59+00:00	New York City stands with survivors of sexual violence and assault. In this city you will be heard and you will be believed. #DenimDay
309	2020-04-29 18:30:53+00:00	Cupid is coming to New York City! Project Cupid will allow couples to get married online by the end of next week. Thank you to @NYCSpeakerCoJo, the City Clerk’s Office and DOITT for coming together in the spirit of love to get this done. Go to http://nyc.gov/cupid for more.
310	2020-04-29 17:19:47+00:00	We’re helping protect homeless New Yorkers from COVID-19 by moving 1,000 more of our homeless residents into hotels per week. We’re bringing a testing program to shelters, isolating anyone who tests positive. Testing will be available across our entire shelter system by mid-May.
311	2020-04-29 17:19:47+00:00	We’re also beginning a new initiative, offering antibody tests to over 150,000 health care personnel and first responders. Antibody tests can tell someone if they've been exposed and recovered from COVID-19 — that’s something that will give people more confidence in their work.
312	2020-04-29 17:19:46+00:00	A new collaboration with the Department of Defense, @NYCFirstLady and @NYCHealthSystem will train 1,000 public hospital personnel and more private hospital staff in combat stress management, helping frontline workers individually and connecting them with programs and support.
313	2020-04-29 17:19:46+00:00	There are superb programs available right now, 24/7, to help our doctors, nurses, EMTs and paramedics cope with crisis. But now we’re bringing in the US military to set up new ones designed for the battlefield trauma and conditions so many are facing.
314	2020-04-29 17:19:46+00:00	The emotional toll this pandemic is taking on our health care workers and first responders has to be addressed. What they’re seeing every day parallels the kind of stress soldiers face in war. It’s called Combat Stress, and it’s happening in our city.
315	2020-04-29 17:19:46+00:00	Think of our families who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. Of our seniors who are isolated. Of our parents dealing with the anxiety of losing a paycheck. Of our kids growing up in a fearful time. Mental health is a crisis WITHIN this crisis.
316	2020-04-29 13:47:32+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
317	2020-04-29 01:41:04+00:00	We have lost so many these last two months + I understand the instinct to gather to mourn. But large gatherings will only lead to more deaths + more families in mourning. We will not allow this. I have instructed the NYPD to have one standard for this whole city: zero tolerance.
318	2020-04-29 01:35:09+00:00	My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period.
319	2020-04-29 01:29:25+00:00	Something absolutely unacceptable happened in Williamsburg tonite: a large funeral gathering in the middle of this pandemic. When I heard, I went there myself to ensure the crowd was dispersed. And what I saw WILL NOT be tolerated so long as we are fighting the Coronavirus
320	2020-04-28 23:38:30+00:00	It's really simple: the more testing we do, the faster we can move to the low level transmission phase — and the closer we get to winning the COVID-19 fight. That’s why we’ve expanded testing to some of New York City’s hardest hit communities. More: http://nychealthandhospitals.org
321	2020-04-28 22:02:30+00:00	We're helping communities hurting in this crisis to fight back and stay safe. Proud to join @BPEricAdams at Marcy Houses to hand out face coverings, gloves and supplies to residents.
322	2020-04-28 21:00:16+00:00	This @FEMA team’s from Texas, the @FDNY is from right here in the five boroughs, but they share one goal: saving the lives of New Yorkers. We’re humbled by all of them.
323	2020-04-28 17:53:21+00:00	To small business owners: you deserve this money and your city wants you to access it. It's still first come, first serve so apply immediately at http://SBA.GOV. We are here to help. Call 311 if you need assistance with the application.
324	2020-04-28 17:53:20+00:00	Small businesses are struggling right now — and to add insult to injury, federal aid initially went to big businesses instead. I want to applaud @SenSchumer and @NydiaVelazquez for knocking down obstacles and making the aid process fairer.
325	2020-04-28 17:22:51+00:00	I want to close with a message to our students: if you feel like you’re going through a lot, we understand. We’re here to support you every step of the way. I’ve seen firsthand how inspiring and extraordinary you are. We have a bright future ahead because of you. Thank you.
326	2020-04-28 17:22:51+00:00	We won’t let the COVID-19 crisis stop us from fighting the digital divide. We’re putting technology in the hands of every child. By April 30th, 247,000 iPads will have been delivered to our students. Request a learning device by calling 311 or go to http://schools.nyc.gov.
327	2020-04-28 17:22:51+00:00	No matter what, we’ll also host one big citywide virtual graduation for the class of 2020. We’ll have more details in the weeks to come, including a roster of special guests. Our seniors deserve nothing less.
328	2020-04-28 17:22:51+00:00	Our seniors have worked too hard to miss out on one of life’s defining moments. Every school will mark graduation in its own way, even if we can’t hold traditional ceremonies.
329	2020-04-28 17:22:51+00:00	Any student who receives a “course in progress”—especially our high school seniors—will be enrolled in summer programs to get them caught up.
330	2020-04-28 17:22:50+00:00	High school grading will continue, but with more flexibility. If students pass a class and earn credit, they can decide whether to take a letter grade or a simple “pass” that won’t affect their GPA.
331	2020-04-28 17:22:50+00:00	"Middle school is already a tough time and now students have a whole new set of challenges. For them, there will be three grades: ""meets standards"" ""needs improvement"" and ""course in progress"" for students who need more time over the summer to complete school work."
332	2020-04-28 17:22:50+00:00	"For K-5th grade, instead of traditional grades there will be two standards: ""meeting standards"" or ""needs improvement."" Students will be evaluated based on school projects, assignments and writing. Any student struggling will get the help they need to catch up."
333	2020-04-28 17:22:49+00:00	A lot of kids are going to need help catching up after this crisis ends. Some will just need a little help, some will need a lot. We’ll be matching each student with support programs this summer and into the fall to get back on track.
334	2020-04-28 17:22:49+00:00	Today we’re announcing a new grading policy for the current semester that fits the moment we're in NOW — one that keeps our standards in place but adds flexibility because of what students and families are going through.
335	2020-04-28 17:22:49+00:00	We have to help seniors graduate. We have to help students that are struggling to catch up. And we have to be honest that this is a moment of crisis and trauma for families. We can’t pretend this is business as usual.
336	2020-04-28 17:22:49+00:00	We asked teachers, students and parents to do something unprecedented — to take the nation’s largest school system, over a million kids, and convert to online learning within a matter of days. It has not been easy, but they took up the challenge. THANK YOU!
337	2020-04-28 13:43:45+00:00	I’m live at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
338	2020-04-27 19:55:01+00:00	“Coronavirus is the Great Equalizer.” How many times did we hear that in the early days of this crisis? But it’s not true. COVID-19 does discriminate. Read @NYCFirstLady and my latest for @BuzzFeedNews:
339	2020-04-27 19:12:16+00:00	MORE good news: As our streets continue to stay clean, we are suspending Alternate Side Parking for an additional two weeks, until May 12th.
340	2020-04-27 19:12:15+00:00	We will go into May with an aggressive test and trace strategy in place. This is a good way to start the week.
341	2020-04-27 19:12:15+00:00	We’re building out a contact tracing network on a scale never seen before in this city. We need 1,000 contact tracers with health experience immediately to conduct interviews, arrange for testing and get those who need it into isolation. Apply now: http://fphnyc.org.
342	2020-04-27 19:12:15+00:00	We’re rapidly standing up our operation to trace the contacts of anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 so we can test, isolate and support them.
343	2020-04-27 19:12:14+00:00	I can’t believe I still have to say this but we need the federal government’s help with testing by expanding lab capacity and sending supplies to labs to keep up with demand. The more tests you do, the faster you can move to low level transmission of this disease.
344	2020-04-27 19:12:14+00:00	We will begin self-swab testing right away — but we can’t do it alone. We need more private labs to step up and process the tests, make adjustments to work with this new approach and help us protect our city.
345	2020-04-27 19:12:14+00:00	Self-swab tests are a simpler, faster and safer way to conduct testing. It will take fewer health care workers to administer the test, increase our testing capacity and reduce health care workers’ risk of exposure to COVID-19.
346	2020-04-27 19:12:14+00:00	Starting this week, we are beginning self-swab tests. When you go to a community site, a health care worker will explain and supervise everything. You'll take a swab from your nose with a q-tip and spit into a cup. That's it.
347	2020-04-27 19:12:13+00:00	We keep expanding testing in our hardest-hit communities. As of this morning, there are 8 @NYCHealthSystem community testing sites around the city, ramping up to 10,000 tests a week.
348	2020-04-27 17:20:49+00:00	Fires, floods, hurricanes — New Yorkers have ALWAYS fought for our fellow Americans in need. And we don’t care if you’re a red state. If our neighbors need help, we’ll bail them out. You want an economic recovery? Support America’s cities the way we’ve supported our country.
349	2020-04-27 15:25:53+00:00	We're focusing on where the need is greatest, prioritizing neighborhoods that have been hardest hit and where we’ll have the biggest impact. I’m glad we’ve found a way to do this safely AND quickly.
350	2020-04-27 15:25:53+00:00	Working with the NYPD, DOT, Parks Department and community organizations we’re going to open up streets in and around parks, expand sidewalks and use barricades to open up neighborhood streets. We’ll also be increasing bike lanes.
351	2020-04-27 15:25:53+00:00	New Yorkers are doing a great job with social distancing but we know warmer weather will bring real challenges. I’m proud to announce we've worked with @NYCSpeakerCoJo, @CMCarlinaRivera and the @NYCCouncil to create more open streets for New Yorkers to enjoy safely.
352	2020-04-27 13:48:09+00:00	We’re at City Hall with updates on COVID-19. Tune in.
353	2020-04-26 23:00:00+00:00	THIS is a statement of who we are as New Yorkers. We will ALWAYS applaud the efforts of our local heroes. To our front line health care personnel: we have your back. Always. #ClapBecauseWeCare
354	2020-04-26 21:29:54+00:00	Congratulations to our @nyc_media team on bringing home the win! The 2019 Women's World Cup Ticker Tape Celebration was an inspiring New York City moment and your @NYEmmyAwards is well-deserved.
355	2020-04-26 19:55:39+00:00	On this #LesbianDayOfVisibility, know that New York City is your home. We see you, we support you and we stand with you.
356	2020-04-26 18:21:22+00:00	"These are the building blocks we need to create a fair recovery. We will not go back to ""normal"" and the status quo. We can and we will build something new and better together. That's what I'm devoted to."
357	2020-04-26 18:21:21+00:00	The last piece of the equation is a Charter Revision Commission. It's the right time to look anew at everything we do. I want this group to think about the big picture of how our government works and serves its people.
358	2020-04-26 18:21:21+00:00	These are leaders who have fought for social justice and change their whole lives. They’ve led our city out of emergencies like the Fiscal Crisis of the 1970s and the aftermath of 9/11. They’ll help us build a fairer and stronger city.
359	2020-04-26 18:21:21+00:00	We don’t just need a recovery, we need a transformation. I am launching the Fair Recovery Task Force, to help us build a more equitable city. I've assembled a group of remarkable New Yorkers to come together and create a preliminary recovery road map for our city by June 1st.
360	2020-04-26 18:21:21+00:00	The task force will be led by @NYCFirstLady and Deputy Mayor Phil Thompson. We will be naming leaders from across the administration representing the diversity of this city. They will help us focus on the bigger structural changes we need to make going forward.
361	2020-04-26 18:21:21+00:00	I am also launching the City Task Force on Racial Inclusion and Equity, focusing on confronting health disparities, specific needs in communities of color and breaking down structural racism. I want that mission baked into every aspect of our restart and recovery.
362	2020-04-26 18:21:20+00:00	We have to plan for the real world and implement a whole new set of rules and guidance. Which businesses should screen for temperatures? What type of protective equipment should employees use? We’ll be answering these questions and a lot more.
363	2020-04-26 18:21:20+00:00	I am launching the Sector Advisory Councils to get this restart right. They’ll each be made up of leaders from every aspect of life in New York City to help us plan not just when we restart but HOW we restart.
364	2020-04-26 18:21:20+00:00	In order for us to think about a restart, we need to see the indicators going down and a massive expansion of testing and tracing. Those two factors MUST come together. We begin to restart ONLY when we have the evidence.
365	2020-04-26 18:21:20+00:00	We're going to learn lessons from this horrible tragedy and make profound changes. To help us do it we’re enlisting New Yorkers on: -Sector Advisory Councils -City Task Force on Racial Inclusion and Equity -Fair Recovery Task Force -Charter Revision Commission
366	2020-04-26 18:21:20+00:00	Every time New York City has faced a crisis, it’s come back stronger. That's who we are. We will work together and build something better and fairer. We have the power to do more than just return to the status quo.
367	2020-04-26 13:32:29+00:00	I’m at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19. Tune in.
368	2020-04-25 16:53:47+00:00	We'll need widespread testing to beat the COVID-19 crisis. I saw the beginning of that strategy taking shape today at our new H+H community testing site in hard-hit Morrisania. The front line workers on the ground there are leading the charge to win this war.
369	2020-04-25 15:09:05+00:00	Right on, Attorney General! The Trump administration is determined to make immigrant New Yorkers afraid to get help like food and health care during a deadly pandemic. We didn’t stand by and let them intimidate our neighbors before this crisis. We won’t let them do it now.
370	2020-04-25 13:00:01+00:00	Here’s my promise to every New Yorker: I’ll be here to give you information every day. Join me to talk about the road ahead. #AskMyMayor
371	2020-04-24 23:37:43+00:00	Health care heroes like the staff at @NYCHealthSystem Kings County are the heart and soul of this fight — fearless, passionate New Yorkers who will do anything to protect their neighbors. @NYCFirstLady and I were honored to thank them tonight. #ClapBecauseWeCare
372	2020-04-24 22:20:19+00:00	Bravo, @GovMurphy! I can't believe a New Yorker is saying this, but let's follow New Jersey's lead — and get this done for our tenants here in our state.
373	2020-04-24 18:30:11+00:00	To the State: let renters use their security deposits to pay rent. Let them defer rent and pay it back over 12 months, and extend the eviction moratorium for 60 days past the end of the crisis. This is an emergency situation. Renters need help NOW. The state needs to act.
374	2020-04-24 18:30:11+00:00	It is ILLEGAL for a landlord to evict you or ask you to leave because you’re sick. If you're struggling with a landlord, call the tenant hotline via 311 for free legal help, regardless of immigration status. If you are threatened with eviction, we’ll step in and stop it.
375	2020-04-24 18:30:10+00:00	So many New Yorkers have lost their jobs and can’t keep the basics going. They can no longer pay for food, medicine or rent. We NEED to make sure every New Yorker can stay in their home. We NEED New Yorkers to know they are secure during this crisis.
376	2020-04-24 17:35:43+00:00	When it comes to our indicators: hospital admissions, ICU admissions, citywide and public health lab positive tests are all DOWN. YOU are the reason why. Keep going.
377	2020-04-24 17:35:43+00:00	We are building tele medicine capacity so more people can get their COVID-19 related medical questions answered directly by a doctor. We’re helping hundreds of doctors offices in our hardest hit communities reach out to their patients remotely.
378	2020-04-24 17:35:43+00:00	We're working tirelessly to reach people in every corner of our city. We have bilingual robocalls to 1.1 million New Yorkers. We’re using social media to reach people in 24 languages. We’re holding tele-town halls with faith leaders and working with community health clinics.
379	2020-04-24 17:35:42+00:00	We've invested $8 million on an awareness campaign in 15 languages. We’ve now initiated a $10 million campaign targeted at the hardest hit communities. Direct mail is getting 3.4 million homes the information they need in English, Spanish and Chinese.
380	2020-04-24 17:35:42+00:00	We currently have testing sites in every borough and we’re adding more sites at hospitals and NYCHA facilities. We have more testing available through One Medical. We’ll be able to run 10,000 tests a week across these sites, and we’re just getting started.
381	2020-04-24 17:35:42+00:00	We’ve hired thousands of new health care personnel, worked with the federal government to bring in hundreds of military personnel and gotten PPE to our hospitals. Now we’re going on the offensive with community testing sites run by the public hospital system.
382	2020-04-24 17:35:42+00:00	Only a few years ago, our public hospitals were in DEEP trouble. There was talk of having to close facilities and lay off health care workers. Instead, we invested billions to rebuild our public hospitals. Thank God we did. It’s allowed us to hold the line now.
383	2020-04-24 17:35:42+00:00	Lower-income communities, immigrant communities and communities of color are being hit hard.
384	2020-04-24 17:35:41+00:00	When this virus began, it was called the great equalizer. No one was immune from it. But in many ways this virus DOES discriminate. It's amplified inequalities in our society that we have been fighting in New York City for six-plus years. It's made those disparities worse.
385	2020-04-24 13:47:45+00:00	I'm at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
386	2020-04-24 13:26:07+00:00	Ramadan Mubarak, New York City! This year’s celebration may look a little different, but faith — in every sense of the word — is at the heart of our response to COVID-19. And we will get through this struggle together. #AskMyMayor
387	2020-04-24 02:30:44+00:00	What does “liberate” mean? It means being free from danger. If we don’t protect our people, we’re not going to be liberated. If we focus on corporations or the stock market instead of the health and safety of families, it will set us back months and people will suffer.
388	2020-04-24 01:45:56+00:00	The Rent Guidelines Board just issued a report on the challenges landlords face during this crisis. But that pales in comparison to what tenants are facing. If ever there was a time for a rent freeze, it's NOW. And that's what I'm calling on the RGB to do.
389	2020-04-23 23:57:27+00:00	The idea of a 24 hour shift being imposed on our Corrections Officers was a mistake and NEVER should have happened. To New York’s Boldest: you’re vital to keeping our city safe. I promise we have your back and that this will never happen again.
390	2020-04-23 20:23:23+00:00	To the Muslim New Yorkers beginning their celebrations tonight who need halal meals, we have them across our 400+ grab and go meal sites, and are bringing hundreds of thousands more to the 32 sites most frequented by our Muslim communities. Go to http://nyc.gov/getfood for more.
391	2020-04-23 20:20:40+00:00	To those celebrating, I know it's painful to not worship together at a mosque or be with your family or friends. But your sacrifice is playing a critical role in fighting this disease and saving lives.
392	2020-04-23 20:19:00+00:00	#Ramadan is a month to reflect, to build discipline and to become closer to God. As our city continues to confront the COVID-19 crisis, every New Yorker can learn from such a profound act of faith. Ramadan Mubarak to all of our neighbors beginning their fast.
393	2020-04-23 17:07:57+00:00	Every time you practice social distancing, you’re depriving the disease of a new avenue. You are fighting back. What you’ve done has had a tremendous impact and should encourage you that you’re doing something absolutely necessary. Let’s finish the job.
394	2020-04-23 17:07:57+00:00	Those who say New York City won’t come back strong don’t understand New Yorkers. New York City will come back because we’ve always come back and found a way to be stronger. It’s who we are and it’s been proven time and time again.
395	2020-04-23 17:07:56+00:00	We have to continue social distancing and sheltering in place. And eventually, when we make enough progress, we can gradually hand off to a testing and tracing strategy that contains the virus.
396	2020-04-23 17:07:56+00:00	We’re decelerating, which is a very good thing. But there’s still real work to be done. Don’t give an inch. Do not relax. Do not allow this disease back in the door.
397	2020-04-23 17:07:56+00:00	I can only imagine what could have been if the federal government had acted when we asked for testing on January 24th. The more testing we have, the better we understand how widespread the virus is. We’re seeing progress but we have a long way to go.
398	2020-04-23 17:07:55+00:00	The New Yorkers in our ICUs are fighting for their lives. The number of people in @NYCHealthSystem’s ICUs is starting to come down, but it's still VERY high. This shows just how vulnerable we’d be if we saw a resurgence of the virus. We CANNOT let that happen.
399	2020-04-23 17:07:54+00:00	Don't be discouraged. On March 31st we had 850 new suspected COVID-19 hospitalizations each day. Now we’re down to 227. It’s much, much better. But that’s still hundreds more seriously ill people coming into our already strained hospitals each day.
400	2020-04-23 17:07:53+00:00	So here are the facts: We've made progress but the coronavirus is alive and well in New York City. We’re seeing thousands of new cases every day, and losing hundreds of lives. We're very much still in the thick of this fight.
401	2020-04-23 17:07:52+00:00	Some states are rushing to reopen. I hope and pray they’re watching the data. I can't think of anything more dangerous right now than making decisions based on politics or the stock market when human lives are at stake.
402	2020-04-23 17:07:52+00:00	"How do we get back to normal? That's THE question on all of our minds. Donald Trump has been talking about ""liberating"" the country. We can only be liberated by the truth — and the truth is we can only re-open when this virus is defeated and we know we can keep our people safe."
403	2020-04-23 13:41:45+00:00	Join us at City Hall with the latest updates on COVID-19.
404	2020-04-23 13:00:00+00:00	Are you worried about paying for health care during the COVID-19 crisis? In New York City we’ve made a solemn promise: cost will NOT be a barrier to care. #AskMyMayor
405	2020-04-23 00:32:52+00:00	Our Chief Climate Policy advisor @dzarrilli is spot on: the COVID-19 crisis has exposed systemic failures — the fight against climate change has to be at the heart of our recovery. #EarthDay50
406	2020-04-22 21:57:53+00:00	The 50th anniversary of Earth Day might feel different from years past. But climate change is still real. COVID-19 has proven that when we work together, share the sacrifice and mobilize we can save lives and stop a global crisis. We can do the same for our planet. #EarthDay50
407	2020-04-22 20:56:20+00:00	@senatemajldr: You’re the leader of the United States Senate. You swore an oath to our country. You can’t dodge your responsibility because it’s too hard. Do your job.
408	2020-04-22 20:17:19+00:00	When Mitch McConnell says we should let states go bankrupt, let’s be honest about what he’s saying: He wants police officers to lose their jobs. He wants firefighters to go broke. He wants hospitals to close and sick people thrown out on the street. Prove me wrong, Mitch.
409	2020-04-22 19:00:13+00:00	The coronavirus didn’t create disparities. It just uncovered them. We’re confronting those inequities with every tool we have.
410	2020-04-22 19:00:12+00:00	A painful reality of this disease is that our seniors are feeling more isolated than ever. We're giving free tablets with internet access to 10,000 NYCHA seniors so they can stay connected with their families. I want to thank @TMobile for partnering with us to get this done.
411	2020-04-22 19:00:12+00:00	We’ll also make regular phone calls to NYCHA seniors to make sure they have the food and supplies they need, and to check on their health. If anyone needs to see a doctor, we’ll make that happen.
412	2020-04-22 19:00:11+00:00	Our pledge to New Yorkers: no one will go hungry. If you need food, call 311 or go to http://nyc.gov/getfood. We’re going to grow our operation to serve meals door to door at NYCHA senior buildings, without the need to sign up in advance.
413	2020-04-22 19:00:11+00:00	We will be delivering supplies to our NYCHA residents, including face coverings and gloves to keep people safe and protect others. We are also bringing more hand sanitizer to our NYCHA seniors.
414	2020-04-22 19:00:10+00:00	Testing is already up at community sites, and we’re adding six more sites in the next few days. NYCHA residents will be given priority.
415	2020-04-22 19:00:10+00:00	The 400,000 New Yorkers who call @NYCHA home are the backbone of our city. And we know they’re feeling the burden of this crisis, above and beyond all the challenges they face in their buildings. They deserve help. We’re going to make sure they get it.
416	2020-04-22 18:42:51+00:00	This is a big undertaking. But just a month ago nobody thought we could manufacture face shields, gowns or ventilators in New York City. We’re doing the impossible every day. And we’re going to have to rise to the occasion again. That’s what’s New York City does.
417	2020-04-22 18:42:50+00:00	We can put together most of this on our own. The missing link is the testing. If we don’t have it in the quantities needed, the rest of the pieces don’t come together. We need the federal government to step up with a vast national testing effort, MUCH bigger than what we see now.
418	2020-04-22 18:42:50+00:00	To do this right, we need tests, testing kits, PPE, labs, personnel and hotel rooms. We could be talking about tens of thousands of people in isolation at any point. We can’t do this today, but we’re gearing up for next month so we can launch as soon as broader testing is ready.
419	2020-04-22 18:42:50+00:00	The plan is called Test and Trace. We’ll need massive amounts of testing, readily available in every community. We’ll need the ability to rapidly trace the contacts of everyone who tests positive, so we can evaluate and isolate them. This is how we keep beating this disease back.
420	2020-04-22 18:42:49+00:00	We're still in the midst of widespread transmission. We need to keep fighting our way out of it — but we also have to plan NOW to win the next phase of this epidemic. We're putting the building blocks in place now to get there.
421	2020-04-22 18:42:48+00:00	My promise to you: I will do everything in my power to get us out of the current phase of this crisis as soon as possible. We need to do the work together to earn our way to the low-level transmission.
422	2020-04-22 16:15:30+00:00	We have the finest City workforce in the world. Under impossible conditions they've continued to get work done for ALL New Yorkers. To our public servants and their families, know that your city has your back. Thank you for all you do.
423	2020-04-22 16:13:59+00:00	Every community has experienced loss due to COVID-19. Every neighborhood has endured heartbreak. I'm sad to report that we've lost more than 200 of our City workers. They were New Yorkers who dedicated their lives to our city. To their families: we will never forget them.
424	2020-04-22 13:44:32+00:00	I'm at City Hall with updates on COVID-19.
425	2020-04-22 13:01:09+00:00	Summer’s going to be very different in our city this year, but I can promise you one thing: we’re working with @Macys to find a safe way to celebrate the Fourth of July. #AskMyMayor
426	2020-04-22 02:34:08+00:00	At this exact moment the men and women of @RUMCSI are on the front lines of this pandemic. Lives will be saved because of their courage. We’re doing everything we can to support them and all of our health care heroes.
427	2020-04-22 00:10:20+00:00	This bill was a good start — but our country will NOT recover if cities and localities don't get direct aid. Cities have led the fight against COVID-19. We need the Trump administration to do the same.
428	2020-04-22 00:08:37+00:00	On behalf of New York City, THANK YOU to @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer for going to bat for our small businesses and hospitals — and a special thanks to @NydiaVelazquez for protecting businesses in our communities of color. Some MUCH needed relief is on the way.
429	2020-04-21 18:42:15+00:00	We have a thunderstorm warning in effect for the city and a tornado warning in effect for the Bronx and Northern Manhattan until 3 PM. STAY INSIDE — and keep an eye on @NotifyNYC for further updates.
430	2020-04-21 17:09:32+00:00	Big Oil? Big Bailout. Biggest city in America? Big nothing. @realDonaldTrump has the power to help New York City in the upcoming stimulus bill — but surprise, surprise: he's putting his billionaire buddies first and his hometown last.
431	2020-04-21 16:48:12+00:00	There's something about this city. When the going gets tough, the BEST comes out in people. New Yorkers are doing things big and small to make a difference. We're resilient, we're tough and we will take care of each other. No disease will ever stop us.
432	2020-04-21 16:48:12+00:00	We NEED to be more self-sufficient and protect ourselves. We'll make our own face shields, surgical gowns, test kits and ventilators here at home, building a stockpile so we never have to turn to those who are supposed to supply them and hear “sorry, we’re all out.”
433	2020-04-21 16:48:12+00:00	We couldn’t get surgical gowns so I asked for fabric and I want to thank the North Carolina company Owens & Minor for going to bat for us. They sent enough U.S.-made fabric for 400,000 surgical gowns. Special thanks to UPS for getting this delivery to us in record time.
434	2020-04-21 16:48:11+00:00	These bridge ventilators will help New Yorkers survive. They'll buy us time for full service ventilators, stretch out the capacity of the hospital as they wait for more ventilators and assist patients with less severe respiratory symptoms who still need help breathing.
435	2020-04-21 16:48:11+00:00	It would normally take more than a year to design a device like this and get the needed approvals. We did it in a month. And now we’re ordering 3,000 NYC-made bridge ventilators that will help prepare us for whatever comes.
436	2020-04-21 16:48:11+00:00	Thanks to Scott Cohen of @NewLab, Marcel Botha of @10XBeta and Charles Boyce with @BoyceTechInc, we will purchase 3,000 bridge ventilators at a significantly cheaper rate than full ventilators.
437	2020-04-21 16:48:10+00:00	We make things happen in New York City. We knew we couldn't count on help to show up fast enough in the COVID-19 crisis so we started manufacturing our own bridge ventilators. This is a remarkable achievement and a testament to the creativity and ingenuity of New Yorkers.
438	2020-04-21 14:48:00+00:00	I can’t tell you when we’ll be able to host cultural events and parades again. But I can tell you WHO our first parade will be for: When the time is right, New York City will honor our health care workers and first responders with a ticker tape parade up the Canyon of Heroes.
439	2020-04-21 13:31:59+00:00	We're at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
440	2020-04-21 13:02:01+00:00	Our EMTs and paramedics have gone above and beyond to save lives in the fight against COVID-19 — so let me tell you how their city is supporting them on the front lines. #AskMyMayor
441	2020-04-21 00:12:46+00:00	Six million Jews were murdered because hatred was allowed to go on unchecked. On #YomHaShoah, as anti-Semitism once again rears its ugly head across globe, we must recommit to those two powerful words: #NeverAgain.
442	2020-04-20 21:49:25+00:00	It’s hard to believe it has been 21 years since Columbine. It’s even harder to believe how many more lives have been lost since that tragic day — and how little has been done to stop the killing. We can't waste another year without common sense gun control.
443	2020-04-20 21:24:58+00:00	It’s really simple: you WILL NOT have a recovery if cities and localities don’t get the support they deserve If @realDonaldTrump leads, the @SenateGOP will follow. It’s time to lead, Mr. President.
444	2020-04-20 20:35:20+00:00	"Back in March, we knew lives would be lost if our city ran out of ventilators. We also knew we couldn't wait on help from others. So we didn't. Now we're making ""bridge ventilators"" right here in the five boroughs. Find out more: "
445	2020-04-20 19:34:03+00:00	This crisis is like nothing we've ever seen. No one knows how this will go but we CAN say that this crisis has an end point. Are New Yorkers strong enough, tough enough and resilient enough to get to that point? The answer is yes. And I have no doubt we'll make it.
446	2020-04-20 19:33:36+00:00	Mr. President, when the airline industry was in trouble you gave them $58 billion. But when cities and states are pleading for help you're silent. The world is watching. Say the word and the Senate will act. Without aid, our city won't recover — and neither will the country.
447	2020-04-20 19:32:57+00:00	We are the epicenter of the crisis and too often we're fighting this battle alone. We haven't hesitated. We need the Federal Government to do the same.
448	2020-04-20 17:31:13+00:00	When we saw @FDNY and EMS needed back up, we worked with FEMA to bring support from across the country. We now have 350 more ambulances, 790 EMTs and paramedics from 19 states. That's given our hometown heroes some much needed relief. Thank you to everyone who’s come to our aid.
449	2020-04-20 17:31:13+00:00	We're not out of the woods, but we're seeing fewer calls and faster response times. That's huge progress.
450	2020-04-20 17:31:12+00:00	A few weeks ago calls to EMS and 911 spiked to record levels. We’d never seen anything like it before. I want to thank @FDNY and especially EMS for holding the line and working long hours to save lives.
451	2020-04-20 17:31:12+00:00	The Federal Government sent 265,000 Tyvek suits and fabric for 400,000 surgical gowns as an alternative. We're grateful for that. But something's wrong when surgical gowns are in short supply in the richest nation in the world.
452	2020-04-20 17:31:12+00:00	But we have a growing problem: surgical gowns. We're not sure we'll have enough to get to Sunday. We’re appealing to the Federal Government and scouring for every workable alternative to keep our health care workers protected.
453	2020-04-20 17:31:12+00:00	By crisis standards, we have a sufficient supply of N95 masks, face shields and gloves for this week. And we have enough ventilators as well — that’s the good news.
454	2020-04-20 17:31:12+00:00	New Yorkers have to protect them by staying home. And we need to make sure they have the PPE to keep them safe, so they can keep saving lives.
455	2020-04-20 17:31:12+00:00	I want you to take a moment to imagine what it’s like for our health care workers waking up and going to work in our hospitals every single day during this crisis. The physical and emotional toll is enormous.
456	2020-04-20 13:37:57+00:00	I’m at City Hall with your latest COVID-19 updates.
457	2020-04-20 13:00:00+00:00	Congress could vote on the next stimulus package this week. Guess how much direct aid @realDonaldTrump and the @SenateGOP have put aside for New York City, the epicenter of this crisis? Nothing. #AskMyMayor
458	2020-04-20 00:54:44+00:00	Republican AND Democratic mayors are demanding more direct aid to cities in the next stimulus. To anyone hoping for an economic recovery: there won't be one if we don't make the localities on the front lines of this pandemic whole.
459	2020-04-20 00:01:39+00:00	Noach Dear was unforgettable. He had a fighting spirit and always put his constituents first. On behalf of his city, I offer our deepest condolences to his family, friends and the people of Midwood, Borough Park and Bensonhurst who he so dutifully served.
460	2020-04-19 20:19:34+00:00	Mr. President, if you don’t help New York City — the nation’s largest city — back on its feet, you can kiss your economic recovery goodbye.
461	2020-04-19 20:18:46+00:00	Senate Republicans are trying to stop a stimulus bill that would provide aid to cities and states. With the snap of his finger, @realDonaldTrump could fix that. He’s been silent.
462	2020-04-19 20:18:01+00:00	.@realDonaldTrump it’s as simple as this: you can step in and fight for your hometown in this next stimulus package or you can turn away and fail to protect New Yorkers. We’re in need. Where are you?
463	2020-04-19 17:12:48+00:00	The message has been clear: KEEP SOCIAL DISTANCING. To anyone who does not understand, we will have to get tougher. You will get a warning first, but anyone who ignores instructions could be fined. We DON’T want to do this. But we have to save lives.
464	2020-04-19 17:12:46+00:00	Those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered: we need you to donate blood. Studies have found the plasma in your blood can help others recover from the disease. Go to http://nybc.org/covidplasma. You will be doing another New Yorker a great favor.
465	2020-04-19 17:12:46+00:00	We've seen the arrival of our military medical personnel to our public hospitals. The first wave was almost 300 medical staff. That number has almost doubled since. They brought skill, pose and inspiration with them. I could not be more appreciative of our armed forces.
466	2020-04-19 17:12:46+00:00	And if we can’t find the right matches in our Medical Reserve Corps we’ll pay for more contracted staff. We HAVE to be there for these hospitals and we will.
467	2020-04-19 17:12:45+00:00	All across the city, our independent hospitals are among those bearing the brunt of this crisis. We're sending them 600 additional medical personnel.
468	2020-04-19 17:12:45+00:00	Our heroes need reinforcements and that’s what they’re getting. As of today, we've added over 1,400 volunteer health care workers to serve New Yorkers. They are being assigned to over 40 hospitals and 40 nursing homes where the need is greatest.
469	2020-04-19 17:12:45+00:00	I know New Yorkers are appreciative of the heroic efforts of our health care workers. The best way to show that appreciation is to continue staying home and practicing social distancing to protect them.
470	2020-04-19 17:12:43+00:00	The reason we’ll beat back this disease is because YOU are practicing social distancing. DON’T stop now. It's going to be beautiful today, but DON’T underestimate our enemy. We cannot let it reassert itself. Stay inside and stay safe.
471	2020-04-19 13:41:10+00:00	Join me at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
472	2020-04-19 13:03:03+00:00	The COVID-19 crisis is taking a toll on our city — including on our mental health. But remember you're not alone. Help is standing by at 1-888-NYC-Well. #AskMyMayor
473	2020-04-18 23:05:49+00:00	Every day we witness the heroism of our health care workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 fight. @GlblCtzn #TogetherAtHome is giving back to make a difference.
474	2020-04-18 18:31:16+00:00	Our Asian-American community is hurting. They are facing violence, attacks and discrimination. It’s not only disgusting, it’s ILLEGAL. Please report any incidents immediately, no immigration status questions asked. We will arrest and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.
475	2020-04-18 16:41:29+00:00	It’s really simple: there won't be a national recovery if New York City is left behind. We’re the epicenter of this crisis. If President Trump doesn’t do his job, our city suffers. The country suffers.
476	2020-04-18 16:41:29+00:00	With a snap of his fingers @realDonaldTrump could get Mitch McConnell's Senate to bail out localities and states on the front lines of this pandemic. He's choosing not to.
477	2020-04-18 16:41:29+00:00	.@realDonaldTrump is leaving localities and states out of the next stimulus bill. This time he’s not just turning his back on his hometown — he’s abandoning the country.
478	2020-04-18 13:02:42+00:00	How do you report places that aren’t enforcing social distancing? It’s simple: just snap a photo and text it to 311-692. #AskMyMayor
479	2020-04-18 01:03:08+00:00	The only thing more inspiring than the outpouring of support for our health care workers is the heroism we’re seeing every day in our hospitals. I’m proud to join @GlblCtzn tomorrow in solidarity with those on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis. #TogetherAtHome
480	2020-04-18 00:42:12+00:00	New York City is the epicenter of this crisis and Elmhurst Hospital has been THE front line. But the spirit of the brave women and men working there is unshaken. They are inspiring and it was my honor to thank them tonight.
481	2020-04-17 20:45:00+00:00	An unprecedented crisis requires an unprecedented response. We’re making a record investment in food — NO New Yorker will go hungry. Not on our watch. Read the plan now: http://nyc.gov/feedingnyc
482	2020-04-17 19:47:47+00:00	There WILL NOT be a national recovery without the nation’s largest city. Mr. President, if you said out loud that we need a Stimulus 3.5 to make the hardest hit cities and states whole, I believe the Republicans in Washington would support you. So it’s time to say it out loud.
483	2020-04-17 19:47:47+00:00	All of our leaders in Washington are praising health care workers and first responders. Don’t just praise them. HELP THEM. With the stroke of a pen you can ensure their work continues and that we have the basic services necessary to get out of this crisis and into recovery.
484	2020-04-17 19:47:47+00:00	New Yorkers are stepping up, fighting back and helping each other. We need Washington to do the same. @RealdonaldTrump and @senatemajldr – here’s your chance. We need the next stimulus to help cities and our frontline workers.
485	2020-04-17 19:16:13+00:00	311 calls have been off the charts. We’re prioritizing urgent requests for food, shelter and health care. We’re hiring 120 more staff to answer calls, but I want New Yorkers to help, too. If your non-COVID 311 call can wait, please call later in the evening or on the weekend.
486	2020-04-17 19:16:13+00:00	We need New Yorkers to help us enforce social distancing. Now you can text a photo to 311-692.
487	2020-04-17 19:16:12+00:00	Today, we canceled all City-permitted non-essential events through May. It’s painful, but it’s what we need to do. This will NOT apply to medical stations, hygiene stations or things relating to food like farmers markets, meal prep or delivery.
488	2020-04-17 19:16:12+00:00	We have ONE chance to get the restart right. If you rush it, if you ignore the warning signs, the virus will reassert itself and we’ll be right back in crisis. We are not going to be back to normal anytime soon.
489	2020-04-17 19:02:51+00:00	We partnered with One Medical and 1199SEIU on a second set of 5 sites to expand testing for those 65 or older with pre-existing conditions, front line and essential workers and vulnerable populations. Call 1-888-ONEMED1 or go to http://onemedical.com and use code NYCCARE30.
490	2020-04-17 19:02:51+00:00	Walk-in community testing sites in Harlem, Morrisania, Jamaica, Clifton and East New York will all be up and running by Monday. They’ll help us test elderly people with pre-existing conditions at greatest risk in this pandemic.
491	2020-04-17 19:02:51+00:00	Right now, with our own resources, we’re building out more testing. 10 new sites across the city will help us test another 6,000 people each week, and we want to grow rapidly.
492	2020-04-17 19:02:51+00:00	Even when we beat back this wave of the virus, we won’t be out of the woods. We’ll need a huge amount of testing, and we’ll need federal help to get it.
493	2020-04-17 19:02:50+00:00	Everyone has the same question: when can we get back to normal? When can we get our lives back? We will move heaven and Earth to get us there but right now that means we keep practicing the strategies that have worked. Stay home and keep social distancing.
494	2020-04-17 18:41:56+00:00	@OpenSociety also donated $15 million to the fund for public schools to support remote learning and child care for the children of essential workers. My deep thanks and appreciation to @georgesoros and @patrickgaspard. This will help so many New Yorkers through this crisis.
495	2020-04-17 18:41:56+00:00	I want to thank @OpenSociety for ensuring our immigrant communities who didn't receive aid from the federal government still get the help and support they need. They donated $20 million to the Immigrant Emergency Relief Fund via The Mayor’s Fund.
496	2020-04-17 13:48:00+00:00	Join me at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
497	2020-04-17 13:00:00+00:00	We need a rent freeze for millions of New Yorkers — but we can’t stop there. It’s time for New York State to take bold action to protect tenants. #AskMyMayor
498	2020-04-17 00:04:36+00:00	Every New Yorker is doing what they can to fight the COVID-19 crisis — but some are going above and beyond. @NYCFirstLady and I joined volunteers to deliver care packages to our front line workers at @NYCHealthSystem in Coney Island tonight — and it was our honor.
499	2020-04-16 21:11:48+00:00	New Yorkers love to compete. We leave it all on the field. We support one another. #WeAreNewYork. Thank you to our home teams for this powerful reminder — and for rooting for us as hard as we root for you.
500	2020-04-16 20:12:58+00:00	We’re also making hotel rooms available free of charge to health care workers who are worried about protecting their own families.
501	2020-04-16 20:12:57+00:00	This is vital to fighting the spread we’re seeing in immigrant communities and communities of color.
502	2020-04-16 20:12:57+00:00	We’re focusing on people in overcrowded homes who live with elders so they can better isolate themselves if they contract COVID-19.
503	2020-04-16 20:12:56+00:00	Right now we’re getting 11,000 hotel rooms ready to help New Yorkers quarantine and protect their families.
504	2020-04-16 16:26:55+00:00	Washington has a real opportunity. They’re debating another stimulus. We could have $250 billion for small businesses, $100 billion for health care and hospital workers and $150 billion for states and localities. And it MUST be based on where the need is greatest.
505	2020-04-16 16:26:55+00:00	.@SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer are pushing for the kind of real relief we need to not just shore up our cities and states, but for getting checks to working people. We all know who the road block is: Mitch McConnell. We need the president's help to move him.
506	2020-04-16 16:26:55+00:00	Of the more than $2 trillion in stimulus passed so far, the airline industry is getting $58 billion. The nation’s largest city and epicenter of this crisis? $1.4 billion in direct aid.
507	2020-04-16 16:26:55+00:00	I want to be clear to @realDonaldTrump and @SenateMajldr McConnell: the only way you have a national recovery is if New York City, the epicenter of this crisis, recovers. If not, you can kiss a recovery goodbye.
508	2020-04-16 16:26:54+00:00	In the last six years, we talked about preparing for a rainy day or a recession. But with this pandemic we've run into something even worse, into a problem that is so unprecedented that getting out of it is something we can't do alone. We need Washington to act and act now.
509	2020-04-16 16:26:53+00:00	Today, I'm releasing our City’s executive budget. A budget is a statement of values — and this city values: Keeping people healthy. Keeping people safe. Keeping food on the table. Keeping a roof over your head. My pledge is simple: your city will protect you. Whatever it takes.
510	2020-04-16 13:49:02+00:00	Join us at City Hall for an update on COVID-19.
511	2020-04-16 13:00:01+00:00	What do you protect in a crisis? We've never faced a budget with choices as tough as this one. My priorities are to protect New Yorkers' health and safety, to keep food on your table and keep a roof over your head. #AskMyMayor
512	2020-04-15 22:47:11+00:00	Our grocery workers are going above and beyond on the front lines of this crisis. We have to protect them. Today we’ve issued new guidance to ALL supermarkets, calling on them to require customers to wear face coverings. We’re here to help grocery stores keep everyone safe.
513	2020-04-15 21:37:43+00:00	April 15th, 1947. Ebbets Field, Brooklyn. Jackie Robinson steps up to the plate and changes the game forever. We may not be able to be on a ballfield today, but the world still feels the impact of the courage of number 42.
514	2020-04-15 20:14:23+00:00	Immigrants helped build our city. They make it run every day — even during a global pandemic. Now more than ever we must celebrate the rich contributions our immigrant communities have made to New York City. #ImmigrantHeritageWeek
515	2020-04-15 18:45:11+00:00	When you look at our food plan, it comes to this basic promise: we will feed every New Yorker. We won’t let anyone fall through the cracks. It’s the right thing to do. We will get it done.
516	2020-04-15 18:45:11+00:00	We're also investing $50 million into an emergency food reserve so we can purchase and store 18 million shelf stable meals. We won’t let temporary shocks in supply come between New Yorkers and the food they need.
517	2020-04-15 18:45:11+00:00	Thanks to the @NYCCouncil’s advocacy and partnership, we’re investing $25 million in emergency funding for our frontline food panties and soup kitchens. They’re a safety net, and they’re under more pressure than ever right now.
518	2020-04-15 18:45:11+00:00	More than 11,000 taxi and for-hire drivers have signed up to deliver free meals for the City. What they’re doing is heroic. And it helps them earn a paycheck to put food on the table for their own families in the process.
519	2020-04-15 18:45:10+00:00	We expect to provide 10 million free meals to New Yorkers in April alone. That’ll grow in May to up to 15 million. We’re serving them out of more than 400 school hubs. And for seniors and vulnerable New Yorkers, we’re delivering to their door.
520	2020-04-15 18:45:10+00:00	If you need food, don’t think twice, don’t be afraid to ask for help. There is no stigma and there is no cost to you. Go to http://nyc.gov/getfood or call 311. Spread the word to everyone you know that your city is here to help.
521	2020-04-15 18:45:09+00:00	Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers lost their livelihoods in the past month. It's an unprecedented challenge, demanding an unprecedented response. We're starting a $170 million initiative to make sure NO New Yorker goes hungry. Read the plan now: http://nyc.gov/feedingnyc
522	2020-04-15 18:27:49+00:00	Face coverings help slow the spread. I couldn’t be prouder to see New Yorkers taking our guidance to heart and wearing them. We’ve been talking with the State about this mandate and applaud the Governor for making this call.
523	2020-04-15 13:40:10+00:00	We’re at City Hall with the latest updates on New York City’s response to COVID-19.
524	2020-04-15 13:00:00+00:00	What is our city doing to help homeless students during the COVID-19 crisis? How about protections for tenants? We’ve got the answers. Join the conversation with your COVID-19 questions using the hashtag #AskMyMayor.
525	2020-04-15 02:30:36+00:00	When the going gets tough, New Yorkers get tougher. Volunteers like the team at @tcahnyc are keeping our city fed and our spirits up.
526	2020-04-14 20:14:27+00:00	Amid all the pain this virus has caused, New Yorkers constantly give us reasons to hope. New Yorkers keep coming up with new ways to fight back, to protect each other. Thank you to all the people working day and night to help overcome this crisis.
527	2020-04-14 20:14:26+00:00	None of this lets the federal government off the hook. This new testing helps, but we’ll need a LOT more to move to wide scale testing across the city. We need Washington to step up in a way they haven’t since this crisis started.
528	2020-04-14 20:14:26+00:00	I want to challenge the whole country to see how far we can take our testing capabilities. If you’re in our city or ANYWHERE in the country and you have a lab, machinery or chemicals to help us make test kits, we need you. Email testhelp@edc.nyc.
529	2020-04-14 20:14:26+00:00	Last week my friend Jim Brainard and the city of Carmel, Indiana donated testing kits to our city. An Indiana firm is now creating their own kits and will send us 50K a week. Combined with the capacity we’re building, we’ll have 100K tests per week. This is a BIG step forward.
530	2020-04-14 20:14:25+00:00	From the start of this crisis we have pleaded with the federal government to get more testing. Today we had a breakthrough. We have a new partner that will get us 50,000 test kits a week, and we’re building a local supply chain to make even more right here in our own city.
531	2020-04-14 20:14:25+00:00	On Sunday I made clear we were worried about the supply of surgical gowns. Today I can tell you that five New York City companies have stepped up and will be making 250,000 per week by May. This is a testament to the speed and the ingenuity of our city.
532	2020-04-14 20:14:25+00:00	I spoke on Sunday about the need for more face shields. Today I can tell you that by the end of April, @BklynNavyYard will be producing 465,000 a week. The goal after will be 620,000 made every week right here at home. That will make New York City self-sufficient.
533	2020-04-14 20:14:24+00:00	We've ALWAYS been home to creativity and entrepreneurship — New Yorkers get things done. And the COVID-19 crisis is no different. We still need federal support, but we aren’t waiting for it. We're manufacturing what we need right here in New York City.
534	2020-04-14 19:26:15+00:00	A BIG thank you to @MikeBloomberg, @BloombergDotOrg and @WCKitchen for this generous donation to keep our front line @NYCHealthSystem heroes fed during the COVID-19 crisis.
535	2020-04-14 13:42:05+00:00	I'm at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19.
536	2020-04-14 13:00:01+00:00	You’ve done incredible work social distancing and protecting your neighbors from COVID-19 — we want you to have all the information you need to win this fight: http://nyc.gov/coronavirus Got questions? We’ve got the answers. Join the conversation using the hashtag #AskMyMayor.
537	2020-04-13 23:00:00+00:00	To our hometown heroes on the front lines and our fellow Americans who came from across the country to support them in fighting the COVID-19 crisis: Thank you. #ClapBecauseWeCare
538	2020-04-13 21:41:25+00:00	Thank you @StarksTheDunk for dishing out this vital assist to our frontline health care workers!
539	2020-04-13 16:30:32+00:00	YOU can make a real impact in helping us end this crisis. If you see a line that is too close together, if a store is too crowded, call 311. Report it and we will send people to follow up. This is your city, your fight and everyone has a role to play in combating COVID-19.
540	2020-04-13 16:30:31+00:00	Some good news for New Yorkers: Alternate Side Parking is SUSPENDED for another two weeks, through Tuesday, April 28th.
541	2020-04-13 16:30:31+00:00	No landlord can evict you or ask you to leave because you’re sick. If you need to protect your rights, New York City has your back. We’ll provide free legal help. I’m launching a tenant hotline for renters in all 5 boroughs through 311 to help you get all of this information.
542	2020-04-13 16:30:31+00:00	Here’s what renters need next: The State should allow renters to defer rent and repay it over the next 12 months using a payment plan. If you’ve lost a job, you deserve real relief. I’m also calling on the State to EXTEND the eviction moratorium to 60 days after the crisis ends.
543	2020-04-13 16:30:31+00:00	This is the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. New York has placed a moratorium on evictions. I’m calling for more. Our city needs a rent freeze on regulated apartments and we need the State to act so renters can use their security deposits to pay rent.
544	2020-04-13 16:30:30+00:00	People won't just hear from us on TV and social media, they’ll be getting texts and robocalls. We’re developing a safe way to reach out door-to-door to spread the word.
545	2020-04-13 16:30:30+00:00	Today I announced we’re laser targeting 88 zip codes with high rates of infection to push out even more information with a new $10 million campaign.
546	2020-04-13 16:30:30+00:00	Since the beginning of March we’ve been running non-stop ads and awareness campaigns in 15 languages, and we’ve partnered with 80 trusted community organizations to spread information on how people can protect themselves. Now we’re taking it a big step further.
547	2020-04-13 16:30:30+00:00	Every community is grappling with this disease, but it is NOT the great equalizer. It has amplified longstanding disparities connected to race, poverty and lack of medical care. Last week I announced a four-point plan to attack these inequalities.
548	2020-04-13 16:30:30+00:00	Right now, all three indicators are moving downward together. It’s a good sign. But that’s a signal NOT to let up. It means we should double down on what’s working. Keep social distancing, keep staying inside, keep protecting our city.
549	2020-04-13 16:30:29+00:00	We want to see all three indicators move DOWN over a prolonged period of time — in unison. When you stay home, you’re helping drive these numbers down. Now you can see your efforts in real-time at http://nyc.gov/coronavirus.
550	2020-04-13 16:30:29+00:00	We are tracking hospital admissions, the number of people in @NYCHealthSystem ICUs and the percentage of people who tested positive for COVID-19. These figures tell us whether we’re making progress or not.
551	2020-04-13 16:30:28+00:00	We are one team right now in this city, all 8.6 million of us fighting this disease together. This is the most important team you will ever be on. We all have to be on the field to win this one. When you stay home, when you socially distance, you’re helping everyone.
552	2020-04-13 13:36:25+00:00	We're at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19. Tune in.
553	2020-04-13 12:45:00+00:00	We closed school buildings to protect our kids. So how do we keep our students learning? We’ve got the answer to that and more of your questions. #AskMyMayor.
554	2020-04-13 00:51:19+00:00	We have strong winds and heavy rain coming our way on Monday, New York City, so it’s really simple: if you do not need to be outside tomorrow then STAY HOME. Keep an eye on @NotifyNYC for updates throughout the day.
555	2020-04-12 23:48:50+00:00	So do I.
556	2020-04-12 22:23:53+00:00	Our libraries are integral to teaching our kids — it’s no surprise that @NYPL, @BKLYNlibrary and @QPLNYC are there for them now to provide the digital books they need. On behalf of the @NYCSchools community: thank you.
557	2020-04-12 22:23:53+00:00	A lot of companies have changed the way they do business to help us reach kids quickly. Thank you to our partners at @Apple, @TMobile, @IBM, @Microsoft, @Google, @Prutech, @GlobalNTT, @FedEx, @UPS and @Deluxe for working with us.
558	2020-04-12 22:23:53+00:00	We have had a lot of help reaching 1.1 million students with remote learning. On behalf of our city, thank you to everyone who has stepped up. You’re making a difference in our children’s lives.
559	2020-04-12 18:52:11+00:00	Happy Easter to all of our neighbors celebrating today. May this season of renewal in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity be a reminder to us all that better days lie ahead.
560	2020-04-12 16:18:06+00:00	These holy days tell us stories of resiliency and faith. Those are the same values New Yorkers are showing each and every day of this crisis.
561	2020-04-12 16:18:05+00:00	@NYCHealthsystem needs workers to help transport patients, clerical staff and cleaning staff — you can apply today at http://nyc.gov/coronavirus.
562	2020-04-12 16:18:05+00:00	Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are out of work right now and have lost their livelihoods. Your city needs you! The City is hiring hundreds of workers RIGHT NOW to help in this crisis.
563	2020-04-12 16:18:05+00:00	@NYCHealthy still recommends all New Yorkers cover their face while in public and as of tomorrow I'm ordering all City government workers who come into contact with the public to cover their face while on duty.
564	2020-04-12 16:18:05+00:00	We will soon be able to expand testing beyond currently hospitalized patients, health care workers and first responders, with @NYCHealthSystem opening test sites for at-risk people in some of the hardest hit communities across the 5 boroughs.
565	2020-04-12 16:18:04+00:00	We have been pleading for more testing from the federal government for months. We could have protected so many lives if they had stepped up. And we STILL need more testing today.
566	2020-04-12 16:18:04+00:00	The number of additional ventilators we need each day has gone down, from more than 200 to around 70. That’s progress, but it still means more of our neighbors are becoming seriously ill every day.
567	2020-04-12 16:18:04+00:00	This was a painful week. We’re all in a state of suspended grief as we lose neighbors and loved ones. We saw the first signs that the course of this crisis might be slowing, but we are nowhere near out of the woods.
568	2020-04-12 13:38:03+00:00	Join me at City Hall for the latest on COVID-19 in New York City.
569	2020-04-12 13:04:21+00:00	This is a time of year when so many faiths talk about resiliency and charity. New York City is living those values right now. #AskMyMayor
570	2020-04-11 18:52:32+00:00	Homeless New Yorkers are our neighbors and we owe them the dignity and support that we give every New Yorker.
571	2020-04-11 18:52:31+00:00	Our homeless neighbors living on the street are going through a lot right now, and we’re working to bring more and more of them inside. To do that in the midst of this crisis we’ll open 230 new Safe Haven beds and low-barrier beds starting this coming week.
572	2020-04-11 18:52:31+00:00	I’ll be blunt: some of our shelters have a lot of space, some do not. In the places where it’s clear that social distancing can’t be achieved properly, a number of those clients will also be moved to hotels for everyone’s safety.
573	2020-04-11 18:52:31+00:00	As of Monday, April 20th, 6,000 single adults, one out of every three in our shelter system, will be in a hotel. This is safer for them, and for the whole city.
574	2020-04-11 18:52:30+00:00	We’re continuing to rapidly move people who are homeless from shelters to hotels whenever necessary to protect their health. We’re prioritizing seniors and anyone with symptoms or who has tested positive for COVID-19. We want to make it easy for people to isolate.
575	2020-04-11 15:22:33+00:00	But the safety of our city and their lives are too important. And I know if anyone can take on the challenge to come, it's our @NYCSchools family.
576	2020-04-11 15:22:33+00:00	This is a heartbreaking decision because our students are such brilliant, hardworking kids. It's a lost opportunity we can't get back.
577	2020-04-11 15:16:40+00:00	5 - Finally, our students are going to come into 2020-2021 school year with challenges beyond anything we’ve ever seen. We owe it to them to make it our greatest academic year yet. We'll have a LOT of catching up to do. We will be working tirelessly until September to get ready.
578	2020-04-11 15:16:39+00:00	4 – We won’t let this crisis come between our seniors and their graduation. They've worked too hard to miss out on this major life milestone. They’ll have one-on-one support in the weeks ahead.
579	2020-04-11 15:16:39+00:00	3 - Our teachers and parents have met this challenge with creativity and ingenuity. Now we’ll be launching new online activities and programs to help them engage our kids.
580	2020-04-11 15:16:38+00:00	2 – Remote learning isn’t easy. Our parents need information and IT support as fast as they can get it — we'll be expanding our parent help line and tech support hours and increasing staffing to meet our families' needs.
581	2020-04-11 15:16:38+00:00	If you’re a parent or student and have requested or still need a device, call 311 or sign up at http://schools.nyc.gov right away.
582	2020-04-11 15:16:37+00:00	1 - We will complete deliveries of internet enabled digital devices for every student who needs them for remote learning. This will be complete before the end of April.
583	2020-04-11 15:08:57+00:00	Closing school buildings doesn't mean we won't be there for our communities. Here's what we're going to do to make sure we support our families in the months to come:
584	2020-04-11 15:08:06+00:00	COVID-19 has been challenging for every New Yorker, but it's been especially difficult on our kids. They're resilient, but this is traumatic. Too many of them have lost someone they love. Each of them has lost normalcy. Everything we do next for our schools will be for them.
585	2020-04-11 15:07:10+00:00	Our health experts believe this is the safest, best approach. I spoke to Dr. Anthony Fauci from the NIAID last night, and he agreed keeping schools closed was important to protecting New Yorkers.
586	2020-04-11 15:04:02+00:00	Today I announced we will close @NYCSchools for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. This is a public health decision — and not an easy one. But it's the right one. The social distancing strategies have been working, and we cannot risk a resurgence of the virus.
587	2020-04-11 13:35:51+00:00	Join us at City Hall for the latest on COVID-19 in New York City.
588	2020-04-11 13:03:24+00:00	Too many people have seen their paychecks go down due to the COVID-19 crisis — how can we let rents go up? #AskMyMayor
589	2020-04-11 01:29:24+00:00	All of us have dug deep into our faith, be it spiritual or otherwise, and have found the strength to keep going, to learn a new way of life that protects the lives of our most vulnerable. There’s something noble happening in New York City. And it’s happening because of you.
590	2020-04-11 01:29:23+00:00	It would be powerful anytime in our history, but it’s especially meaningful that it’s overlapping with Passover, Good Friday and Easter. Those holy days tell the stories of similar struggles and how people overcame them — how they triumphed over impossible adversity.
591	2020-04-11 01:29:23+00:00	This has been a painful week for New York City. The official death toll has surpassed the number of people we lost on 9/11. Every one of us knows someone suffering from this disease. Too many of us know someone who passed away. All of us are making sacrifices.
592	2020-04-11 00:34:22+00:00	We are the epicenter of this crisis. But we’re also watching our city become an epicenter of hope, of heroism and of love for those on the frontlines. @NYCFirstLady and I felt it during shift change at Bellevue tonight. #ClapBecauseWeCare
593	2020-04-10 23:45:47+00:00	This has been a painful week in our city. But our faith in humanity should continue to guide us. You’ve answered the call. The world is watching and applauding your efforts. Let’s show them we will complete this mission and come out of it together.
594	2020-04-10 23:45:47+00:00	I want to thank Carmel, Indiana Mayor James Brainard for sending some of the components we’ll need for 50,000 coronavirus tests. This is immensely helpful and we're so appreciative. Let’s see if the Federal Government can be as effective in getting us testing.
595	2020-04-10 23:45:47+00:00	We NEED large scale coronavirus testing to get back to a semblance of normal. We can't do this alone — Washington needs to take action.
596	2020-04-10 23:17:25+00:00	Look at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center. A week ago it was tennis courts. It’s now a 470 bed hospital with patients from Elmhurst Hospital arriving today.
597	2020-04-10 23:17:25+00:00	A New Yorker in Elmhurst has the same right to a doctor or a ventilator as someone on the Upper East Side. That’s why we’re surging supplies to these front line community hospitals, sending military doctors and nurses to reinforce staff and building NEW temporary hospitals.
598	2020-04-10 23:10:29+00:00	Our entire city is suffering — but in the last few days the disparities are sharper and clearer than ever before. This disease has found EVERY inequality in our society and exacerbated it. That is why places like Elmhurst Hospital have been hit so hard.
599	2020-04-10 22:47:09+00:00	We need a rent freeze. I am calling on the Rent Guidelines Board to freeze rents for all regulated apartments. I’m also asking the State to allow New Yorkers to pay rent with their security deposit. I want to see them act quickly.
600	2020-04-10 22:47:09+00:00	Coronavirus has taken away so many livelihoods. So many are struggling. We will NOT allow any New Yorker to go without the help they need. The City of New York will have your back. We’re making sure there are NO evictions. That was a start, but we can to go further.
601	2020-04-10 22:24:52+00:00	This is outrageous. Council Member, I'm so sorry you had to go through this. You've been a steadfast leader in this challenging time. Thank you to the men and women of @NYPD109Pct for your quick action.
602	2020-04-10 21:15:14+00:00	Dr. Roy Hastick’s smile lit up a room. His passion and work for our Caribbean communities and small businesses will be felt for generations to come. Our city has lost a giant and @NYCFirstLady and I have lost a friend. We’re keeping his family and loved ones in our hearts today.
603	2020-04-10 17:57:37+00:00	Join me at the Billie Jean King Center in Queens with an update on COVID-19.
604	2020-04-10 16:25:44+00:00	We shouldn’t sensationalize the suffering and loss of our neighbors. We should pray for them and keep them in our hearts. And let’s all remain committed to saving each and every life we can in the days ahead.
605	2020-04-10 16:25:44+00:00	The heartbreaking numbers of deaths we're seeing means we are sadly losing more people without family or friends to bury them privately. Those are the people who will be buried on Hart Island, with every measure of respect and dignity New York City can provide.
606	2020-04-10 16:25:44+00:00	For decades, our city has buried people on Hart Island when there is no one else to make burial arrangements. It’s a tragic reality.
607	2020-04-10 16:25:43+00:00	This virus is taking a horrific toll. We’re losing hundreds of neighbors every day. We’ve brought in help from the federal government to ensure we're compassionate and respectful to every family and hold the remains of their loved one until they're ready to make arrangements.
608	2020-04-10 16:25:43+00:00	Whenever we lose someone and there is a family member or a friend, here in New York or around the world, who wants to make burial arrangements, we hold remains until they are ready. Days, weeks, months—it doesn’t matter. COVID-19 has not changed that.
609	2020-04-10 16:25:43+00:00	We do not anticipate temporary burials on Hart Island except for the unclaimed.
610	2020-04-10 16:25:43+00:00	There will be no mass burials on Hart Island. Everything will be individual and every body will be treated with dignity.
611	2020-04-10 16:25:42+00:00	The pictures of our fellow New Yorkers being buried on Hart Island are devastating for all of us. I want to make sure everyone knows what they’re seeing and what is actually happening on Hart Island. Remember, these are human beings. These are neighbors we've lost.
612	2020-04-10 13:00:00+00:00	The COVID-19 crisis has forced so many families apart this holiday weekend — but we’re finding new ways to be together. #AskMyMayor
613	2020-04-10 01:15:30+00:00	Tonight I'm thinking of our health care workers and first responders on the front lines of this fight, and the essential workers keeping our city running. They've kept going because they love our city — and they know their fellow New Yorkers are worth fighting for. #LightItBlue
614	2020-04-10 00:34:55+00:00	Our health care workers in public hospitals have been fighting on the front lines for weeks. We put out the call for help, and the US military answered to reinforce our dedicated @NYCHealthSystem staff. These heroes are saving lives — together.
615	2020-04-09 19:37:22+00:00	It will be a long road. But take pride in yourself and your fellow New Yorkers. Your actions are making a difference. You're pouring your hearts out to our health care heroes on the front lines. Keep it up.
616	2020-04-09 19:37:22+00:00	The goal is to hit a No Transmission phase when life can return to normal. I can't stress enough that this is many MONTHS away — but it IS something we can envision. And to get there, we’ll need a substantial amount of testing. We can’t get there with what we have now.
617	2020-04-09 19:37:21+00:00	Once infections go down, life won’t go back to normal like flipping a switch. We will have to constantly work to prevent a resurgence, because that threat will be very real. It’ll be a long and slow process of relaxing restrictions when the science says it’s safe.
618	2020-04-09 19:37:21+00:00	Farther down the road, if social distancing can steadily drive down the number of new cases, we’ll enter a period of Low-Level Transmission. We’re not close to that yet. But we have to start PREPARING for it today, so that once we win the current battle, we can win that one, too.
619	2020-04-09 19:37:21+00:00	Right now, we still have to prioritize testing to those most at risk, health care workers and first responders due to limited supplies.
620	2020-04-09 19:37:20+00:00	Let's talk about the road ahead. We are in the Widespread Transmission phase. We’re seeing surging new cases and a terrible loss of life. And it’s so widespread we can’t trace where new cases are coming from.
621	2020-04-09 19:37:20+00:00	We need everyone to do their part. If you see a store or a street where people aren’t social distancing, call 311 so we can get agencies on the ground to fix it.
622	2020-04-09 19:37:20+00:00	Social distancing IS working. One of the greatest challenges of our lifetimes was laid down and you answered the call. Now we need to buckle down and keep going.
623	2020-04-09 19:37:19+00:00	If we keep social distancing we can steadily push back this disease and open the door to a different phase when things will get better. We have to fight for it. We will NOT jump the gun or relax restrictions before it’s safe. But we will get to the next phase together.
624	2020-04-09 19:37:18+00:00	We still have a long road ahead in this crisis. We CANNOT expect things to go back to normal anytime soon. We CANNOT let up on our strategies. The only way we make progress is if we double down on what’s working and flatten the curve of this epidemic.
625	2020-04-09 17:51:35+00:00	One more reason to stay inside is on its way, New York City. We have a severe thunderstorm watch in effect until at least 2:15 with winds up to 60 MPH. STAY HOME — and keep an eye on @NotifyNYC for more updates.
626	2020-04-09 13:44:49+00:00	We're at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19 in New York City. Tune in now.
627	2020-04-09 13:00:04+00:00	Spread the word: anyone caught price gouging and exploiting the COVID-19 crisis will PAY. #AskMyMayor
628	2020-04-08 22:29:47+00:00	There’s so much all of us can learn from the story of Passover this year – especially the idea that through faith and love of family we can persevere towards the better days that lie ahead. Chag sameach to all of our neighbors beginning their celebration tonight.
629	2020-04-08 21:27:15+00:00	The progress we’re seeing was built by YOU, by the hard work and sacrifice of every day New Yorkers. I know social distancing is hard, but it's working. We still have a long road to go and now is the time to double down and finish the job — together.
630	2020-04-08 21:27:15+00:00	We're in a good place when it comes to most PPE, but we desperately need surgical gowns. The team at the @BklynNavyYard is creating a great number of supplies but we need more. We’ve asked for over 9 million surgical gowns from the Federal Government to get us through April.
631	2020-04-08 21:27:14+00:00	Yesterday we delivered: 3 million surgical masks 2.1 million gloves 1.2 million N95 masks 100,000 protective eyewear 61,000 gowns to our hospitals. Everything that's come in has instantly gone out to where it’s needed. We’re ensuring every hospital is constantly resupplied.
632	2020-04-08 21:27:14+00:00	We’re adding more beds in new places to relieve the pressure at our hospitals. The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center will accept patients this week. The Center will have 470 beds, including 20 ICU beds.
633	2020-04-08 21:27:14+00:00	The Navy is at Elmhurst, Bellevue, Woodhull and Kings County Hospitals. The Air Force is at Lincoln, Jacobi and Queens. We’re grateful, but we need more help and we need it now.
634	2020-04-08 21:27:13+00:00	Our health care workers have gone through hell — but help has arrived. 300 military personnel have gone to our public hospitals.
635	2020-04-08 21:27:13+00:00	Other steps we are taking to combat COVID-19 disparities: -A huge educational campaign in 14 languages -Grassroots efforts in vulnerable communities -Ensuring New Yorkers can call 311 to speak with a health care provider.
636	2020-04-08 21:27:13+00:00	We NEED to make sure vulnerable New Yorkers can turn to public hospitals and that @NYCHealthSystem gets the supplies and personnel they need. The amazing doctors and nurses at hospitals like Elmhurst are the greatest guarantee we have when it comes to equality in saving lives.
637	2020-04-08 21:27:12+00:00	We have information that points out clear disparities in how this disease is affecting the people of our city, particularly when it comes to vulnerable and marginalized communities. It’s sick, it’s troubling and it’s wrong. It's a status quo that we reject in this city.
638	2020-04-08 21:27:12+00:00	The vast majority of first responders who tested positive or were exposed to COVID-19 have recovered. 276 NYPD officers and 1,310 FDNY EMTs, paramedics and firefighters have returned to duty. They've endured the virus and are going back to save more lives. That's truly powerful.
639	2020-04-08 21:27:12+00:00	I can say with assurance, for the first time, we will get through this week. We cannot accurately predict next week — but the confidence about this week is a good sign.
640	2020-04-08 21:27:12+00:00	Our call for ventilators was heard by the state and federal government in time. We got 500 more from the state this week. We now have 5,500 available at this time and a small reserve of 135 in case the need changes swiftly in one place. This will help us keep pace with the virus.
641	2020-04-08 21:27:11+00:00	In the last few days, we’ve needed fewer ventilators than were originally projected. That’s very important. The hospitalizations have also stabilized and leveled off. The evidence has been good so far, but we have a long way to go. We need to keep fighting.
642	2020-04-08 21:27:11+00:00	There is A LOT to be hopeful about. But we’ve seen around the world that when people take their foot off the gas, COVID-19 reasserts itself. We CAN'T let it resurge. See this progress as an affirmation that you did the right thing — and keep doing it. Stay home.
643	2020-04-08 21:27:09+00:00	New Yorkers were asked to drastically change their daily lives. You went and did it. We're not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot. But the last few days proved that social distancing and shelter in place have helped us fight back against COVID-19 and save lives.
644	2020-04-08 20:10:57+00:00	This cowardly, despicable attack on our New York’s Finest is an attack on every New Yorker. Members of the NYPD are going above and beyond the call of duty to protect all of us in this crisis. Thank you for keeping our city safe.
645	2020-04-08 19:49:51+00:00	THANK YOU to the @USAirForce for sending doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists to help our heroic health care workers at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. Our public hospitals treat EVERYONE — regardless of ability to pay or immigration status. They are THE front lines.
646	2020-04-08 18:47:08+00:00	I take to heart how worried, how anxious people all over this city are right now. It’s a scary time. I want to make sure people on the ground are getting what they need to stay safe, and that we’re keeping public hospitals like Lincoln strong so we can save lives.
647	2020-04-08 18:47:07+00:00	I met with community members this afternoon at Lincoln Hospital, which is in one of our hardest hit communities. We talked about the need for more education and community engagement to protect people in the neighborhood from COVID-19.
648	2020-04-08 13:46:03+00:00	Join us at City Hall with the latest updates on COVID-19 in New York City.
649	2020-04-08 13:00:00+00:00	Social distancing saves lives — we can’t let up now. #AskMyMayor
650	2020-04-07 21:45:17+00:00	I know there’s a special tradition for many during this holiday week of riding the Staten Island Ferry, but we can't do it this year. There won’t be space on the boats to socially distance and stay safe. Please stay home. We’ll celebrate all the more next year.
651	2020-04-07 19:19:09+00:00	This #WorldHealthDay we’re witnessing the courage and sacrifice of our health care workers. To our medical personnel working tirelessly to protect our city from one of the greatest threats of our time, thank you for all you do. 8.6 million New Yorkers are in your debt.
652	2020-04-07 18:32:06+00:00	.@Tunnel2Towers was born out of our city’s darkest hour and dedicated to supporting our heroes. In this dire moment, they’re standing with the men and women on the front lines once more. Their commitment to New York City is an inspiration.
653	2020-04-07 17:38:13+00:00	Because there is no vaccine and no cure, social distancing is our best tool to prevent one person from spreading the virus to many more.
654	2020-04-07 17:37:46+00:00	We know one thing for sure: the ONLY way we will see any sustained positive trend is by continuing, and strengthening, all the tough measures we’ve been using to reduce the virus’ spread.
655	2020-04-07 17:30:38+00:00	We’re watching the numbers closely, but the need for social distancing, face covering and all the other precautions we’ve given New Yorkers stays the same. Those are the best tools to slow the spread and save lives, and we cannot take our eye off that ball for a second.
656	2020-04-07 17:30:33+00:00	We are seeing some signs the rapid acceleration of COVID-19’s spread may be slowing. In our public hospitals, the demand for ventilators held roughly steady over a 24 hour period. That will help our supply hold out longer.
657	2020-04-07 15:48:45+00:00	This is why we call them New York’s Finest! Thank you to @NYPD112Pct Officers DeSantis and Tuohey for being there for one of our most vulnerable neighbors in Rego Park during the COVID-19 crisis.
658	2020-04-07 14:04:52+00:00	I’m at PS 1 in Manhattan to thank School Food Service Workers keeping New Yorkers fed during the COVID-19 crisis.
659	2020-04-07 13:00:43+00:00	Are you worried about where your next meal is coming from? Your city is here to help. #AskMyMayor
660	2020-04-07 12:19:13+00:00	NOBODY goes hungry in New York City — not on our watch. Free meals are available to every New Yorker at 400 locations — text ‘NYC FOOD’ or ‘NYC COMIDA’ to 877-877 for more. http://schools.nyc.gov/freemeals
661	2020-04-06 20:44:56+00:00	"“I'm thinking of our firefighters, I'm thinking of our EMS, our EMT workers, our paramedics...I just want you to know how much we appreciate you."" – @CardinalDolan Amen, Cardinal. We couldn't do this without the men and women in every part of the @FDNY family."
662	2020-04-06 18:41:43+00:00	If you see discrimination or a hate crime call 311 or 911 immediately. We will throw the FULL weight of the law at perpetrators.
663	2020-04-06 18:41:42+00:00	In the midst of this crisis, we've seen discrimination and hatred directed at our Asian American community. It’s sickening. We will use the full force of the law to protect people.
664	2020-04-06 18:41:42+00:00	Today I walked a factory floor where dozens of New Yorkers of Asian heritage were sewing the surgical gowns that will protect hospital workers. I let them know how thankful I was, and how proud I was to be there with them.
665	2020-04-06 17:43:59+00:00	Governor, words can’t express what this means to New Yorkers right now. We won’t forget this act of solidarity. Thank you. Our fellow Americans can count on New York City to pay it forward the moment we can.
666	2020-04-06 17:11:29+00:00	It is our time to fight this battle and make an imprint on history. That’s exactly what New Yorkers are doing across our city and that should make us all inspired and proud.
667	2020-04-06 17:11:28+00:00	With the President's help, the federal government sent a major supply of N95 masks — 600,000 for our independent hospitals and 200,000 for our public hospitals. We'll make it through the week, but we still need more surgical gowns & ventilators. The clock is ticking.
668	2020-04-06 17:11:28+00:00	Our public hospitals have enough gowns for this week but private hospitals and nursing homes are running low. We NEED more gowns urgently — and even as we stand up local production, we need the federal government's help to get our health care workers what they need.
669	2020-04-06 17:11:28+00:00	The @BklynNavyYard served as a crucial spot during WWII. It was where troops left for battle and where ships were built. Today, it’s a symbol to the city and the nation of extraordinary service in the fight against COVID-19. History has come full circle in a powerful way.
670	2020-04-06 17:11:28+00:00	By the end of the month, local factories like the one in the Navy Yard will deliver 300,000 surgical gowns to our front line hospitals. These are absolutely critical to protect our health care workers.
671	2020-04-06 17:11:28+00:00	We're seeing people come together in common cause at @BklynNavyYard. Lafayette 148 and Crye Precision are now making surgical gowns for our front line health care workers and first responders. This is a wartime moment — and New Yorkers are fighting back with everything we've got.
672	2020-04-06 14:07:24+00:00	Join us at @BklynNavyYard for an update on our city's response to the COVID-19 crisis.
673	2020-04-06 13:00:00+00:00	When will you actually get your stimulus check? We've got that answer and more. #AskMyMayor
674	2020-04-06 01:08:17+00:00	Our city and ALL cities need the federal government to enlist all doctors and health workers, and mobilize them in a way we’ve never seen. Here’s how we get that done:
675	2020-04-05 23:45:59+00:00	THIS is a beautiful New York City moment. On behalf of all New Yorkers, thank you to our first responders and health care workers on the front lines, supporting each other and keeping our city safe during this crisis.
676	2020-04-05 22:40:16+00:00	To anyone out there who can help, please, we need you. We need supplies, we need medical personnel to come forward. We need so much support to get through this crisis. Go to http://nyc.gov/helpnow or call 833-NYC-0040.
677	2020-04-05 22:40:16+00:00	The Federal Government responded, sending us: 174 nurses 104 doctors 13 respiratory therapists That's a start. Now let’s keep going.
678	2020-04-05 22:40:15+00:00	Our public hospitals are at the front of the front line. I appealed to the President and FEMA for 1,450 medical personnel from the military. That is: 1,000 nurses 300 respiratory therapists 150 doctors
679	2020-04-05 22:40:15+00:00	To date we’ve delivered 2,865 ventilators and 1,780 BiPAP machines to hospitals. We have 135 ventilators left in reserve for this entire city of 8.6 million people. We’re counting on federal and state stockpiles to get our hospitals through the difficult days ahead.
680	2020-04-05 22:40:15+00:00	We believe we can get to Tuesday or Wednesday with the ventilator supply we have on hand. We’ll need between 1,000 and 1,500 more by next Sunday to keep up with the new cases we’re seeing every day.
681	2020-04-05 22:40:15+00:00	We MUST protect our heroes on the front lines in our hospitals. We have enough of most PPE supplies to get through this week ahead. We’re counting on more deliveries of N95 masks and surgical gowns coming in.
682	2020-04-05 22:40:15+00:00	We knew this coming week would be our hardest yet. And we knew saving lives depended on getting more help in time. We are far from out of the woods but some of that help is starting to come through.
683	2020-04-05 19:34:46+00:00	Join me at City Hall for an update on our COVID-19 response.
684	2020-04-05 17:18:25+00:00	Co-op City is the largest housing cooperative in the city — and it’s going to STAY affordable for the Bronxites who call it home. Even in a crisis, we had to get this done.
685	2020-04-05 13:00:00+00:00	We’ve asked New Yorkers to wear face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19. Now the CDC is urging the same. Here’s why: #AskMyMayor
686	2020-04-04 21:43:07+00:00	There are almost 5 million doctors and nurses across the country. We need 45,000 in New York City to prepare for the worst. A national enlistment effort would organize and send those available here NOW, and dispatch them to other cities and states in need.
687	2020-04-04 19:22:20+00:00	We strongly support Governor Cuomo’s order to acquire any unused private ventilator and bring it where it’s needed to save lives. If a private organization, company or individual refuses, I’m authorizing the NYPD to ENSURE items are turned in to wherever the need is greatest.
688	2020-04-04 19:22:20+00:00	Our city is facing a dire shortage of ventilators. It is unthinkable to leave a single ventilator in a stockpile or in a warehouse when they could save lives in our hospitals. We need these supplies.
689	2020-04-04 19:22:19+00:00	We have another difficult week ahead, and our single-minded focus is bringing in the ventilators, hospital beds and health care workers we need to save every life we can.
690	2020-04-04 18:47:28+00:00	It’s been a painful 24 hours in New York City. We’re losing so many New Yorkers. These aren’t numbers — these are people we know and love.
691	2020-04-04 16:54:02+00:00	Thank you, Governor Brown and thank you, Oregon. Today the front is New York — but as soon as we’re able, our country can count on this city to be there with the supplies and medical personnel to help every other city and state in need as we fight COVID-19.
692	2020-04-04 15:30:31+00:00	Thank you to @Rihanna's @claralionelfdn and one of our great hometown heroes @S_C_ with @ShawnCarterSF for your generosity! This will help our students and @NYCSchools educators through the COVID-19 crisis. We are grateful for your continued compassion and assistance.
693	2020-04-04 13:01:23+00:00	To every doctor, nurse and health care professional: we need you. http://nyc.gov/helpnow #AskMyMayor
694	2020-04-04 00:35:21+00:00	On behalf of 8.6 million New Yorkers, thank you, @Bethenny Frankel! These 200,000 masks are a HUGE help — and will go directly to our front line workers who are working tirelessly to save lives.
695	2020-04-03 22:41:00+00:00	It’s time for the Commander in Chief to give the order. We CANNOT leave the military on their bases. Bring them all to the front. Now.
696	2020-04-03 22:41:00+00:00	There's a peacetime approach in Washington and that won't cut it. I'm calling for a national enlistment effort for ALL available medical personnel into the fight against coronavirus.
697	2020-04-03 22:41:00+00:00	Our health care workers are in their hardest and finest hour. We need to give them support. We need 45,000 more clinical staff to bolster the ranks on the front lines. We’re bringing on 3,600 contracted health workers and nearly 1,000 volunteers—they’ll just be the first wave.
698	2020-04-03 22:41:00+00:00	Following Governor Cuomo's order, if any private organization, company or individual has lifesaving supplies or equipment and refuses to share them, I'm authorizing the NYPD to ENSURE these items are turned over and brought to where the need is greatest.
699	2020-04-03 22:40:59+00:00	I want to commend Governors Cuomo and Murphy for taking the crucial step to order private companies to release any stockpile they have of crucially needed supplies. This is EXACTLY the kind of action we need to say and I'd urge any state in the nation to do the same.
700	2020-04-03 22:40:59+00:00	I spoke to the President and his team last night and told them we needed 200,000 N95 masks. I want to thank them for following through and rapidly delivering them to our public hospitals. That shows just how quickly the federal government is capable of moving.
701	2020-04-03 22:40:59+00:00	We're looking to the Federal and State stockpiles. We’re scouring every private source, every possible manufacturer. We know we’re not the only place facing challenges, but we are the epicenter. We need these supplies.
702	2020-04-03 22:40:59+00:00	The next big test comes next week. We'll need 2,500-3,000 ventilators. It will be a matter of life and death in our hospitals.
703	2020-04-03 22:40:59+00:00	We have a tough fight ahead. New York City needs a staggering amount of equipment and personnel to meet this crisis and save every life we can. 15,000 more ventilators 45,000 more medical personnel 65,000 more hospital beds We believe we can do it — IF we get the help we need.
704	2020-04-03 19:38:41+00:00	We’re at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19. Tune in:
705	2020-04-03 19:18:11+00:00	We've called on medical staff from around the country to join our fight in New York City. Today, @United Airlines and @JetBlue stepped up to help fly them here. On behalf of our city and the lives that will be saved: thank you.
706	2020-04-03 18:49:14+00:00	Our city and all cities need the federal government to enlist doctors and health workers — and mobilize them in a way we’ve never seen. Here’s how it would work:
707	2020-04-03 13:03:13+00:00	Should you cover your face when you go outside? Yes. Join me to talk about why. #AskMyMayor
708	2020-04-03 12:33:46+00:00	Lenin Fierro immigrated from Ecuador, served in the Navy and then joined DCAS to help implement Vision Zero from the beginning. He personally trained thousands of City drivers— truly a life-saving gift to New Yorkers. Our thoughts are with his loved ones.
709	2020-04-03 01:15:05+00:00	Across our city and our nation, we're seeing people stepping up to aid us in this crisis. Thank you @Uber and @UberEats for taking care of our heroes on the front line. We will get through this — by looking out for each other.
710	2020-04-02 23:28:34+00:00	The worst weeks are ahead but we will NOT give in. That's not who we are. Today I saw resolve, toughness and the incredible spirit of perseverance. I'm very, very proud of you all. I have no question we will see this through together.
711	2020-04-02 23:28:34+00:00	Small business update: starting tomorrow the federal Paycheck Protection Program opens up. It's a $350 billion loan program for businesses and non-profits up to 500 employees. It's first come, first serve. Apply as early as possible Friday morning at http://SBA.gov.
712	2020-04-02 23:28:34+00:00	If you’re in private practice, if you’re a veterinarian, if you’re a plastic surgeon: we need your ventilator NOW. Go to http://nyc.gov/helpnow or call 833-NYC-0040.
713	2020-04-02 23:28:33+00:00	400 ventilators have come in and we’ll rapidly put them in place, thanks to the resupply just sent by the State and federal government. We will get through Sunday, but we need 2,500 to 3,000 more next week to save lives. THAT should be a national priority.
714	2020-04-02 23:28:33+00:00	We need a national enlistment of medical personnel. Anyone with medical training that can be spared needs to come to the front. Today the front is NYC, but it will be all 50 states. If we're going to save lives it means enlisting health professionals in national service.
715	2020-04-02 23:28:33+00:00	I was clear with the President that we need nothing less than the full mobilization of the military. This is a wartime dynamic and right now too much of what is happening is on a peacetime basis. There's a disconnect we have to fix immediately because this crisis is only growing.
716	2020-04-02 23:28:33+00:00	I spoke with the President today about what we will face next week and our urgent need of 2,500 to 3,000 ventilators immediately. He understands the number of beds we're adding. We had a good conversation and I'm thankful for the help we've received, but we need more immediately.
717	2020-04-02 23:28:32+00:00	Face coverings are an added precaution to protect others in case you have contracted COVID-19 but don’t have symptoms.
718	2020-04-02 23:28:32+00:00	This is a new precaution our health experts recommend based on evidence published in the last 24 hours. It doesn’t replace social distancing. We want you to keep that 6-foot distance from others we’ve been talking about!
719	2020-04-02 23:28:24+00:00	We have new guidance for New Yorkers: We're advising New Yorkers to wear a face covering when you go outside and near others. It can be a scarf, a bandana or one you make at home. But PLEASE: save medical masks for our health care workers & first responders who truly need them.
720	2020-04-02 23:17:38+00:00	.@SenSchumer has gone to the mat for our city, state and country every single day since the COVID-19 crisis began. Period, full-stop.
721	2020-04-02 20:49:03+00:00	I'm at City Hall with the latest on COVID-19. Tune in.
722	2020-04-02 13:35:00+00:00	Our paramedics and EMTs are on the front lines of this crisis. They're putting their lives on the line for our city — it's why we call them New York's Best. My honor to visit with them at FDNY EMS Station 50 in Queens this morning to say thank you on behalf of their city.
723	2020-04-02 12:57:49+00:00	New York City’s paramedics and EMTs are going above and beyond the call of duty. They’re saving lives every day in this crisis. And backup just arrived to help them save even more. #AskMyMayor
724	2020-04-01 23:52:40+00:00	We've known for a long time that New Yorkers are the strongest, the toughest and the most resilient. Every day people are donating food, masks, gloves. It's been nonstop. This virus is tough but it's no match for the people of New York City.
725	2020-04-01 23:52:40+00:00	This will be an epic process through the month of April. It's herculean, but I believe it can be reached.
726	2020-04-01 23:52:40+00:00	Hospitals are adding 50% capacity to the space they have, which will add almost 10,000 beds. Field hospitals like Javits, the USNS Comfort, Billie Jean King Tennis Center and Brooklyn Cruise Terminal will add thousands and we are bringing hotels online.
727	2020-04-01 23:52:39+00:00	Our goal is to TRIPLE the number of hospital beds. By the end of April we need: 20,000 ICU beds 65,000 hospital beds
728	2020-04-01 23:52:39+00:00	Every single week we will need MORE supplies and MORE ventilators. Based on specific projections, we will need 15,000 ventilators over the next few weeks. The second we don't need them, we will share them immediately with our fellow Americans.
729	2020-04-01 23:52:39+00:00	We have seen a tremendous response from New Yorkers with medical training volunteering to serve our city. More and more are coming forward. THANK YOU! Additionally, I've requested 1,000 military medical personnel from the White House and Pentagon.
730	2020-04-01 23:52:38+00:00	Now for what we NEED by this Sunday: 3.3 million N95 masks 2.1 million surgical masks 100,000 surgical gowns 400 ventilators We have requests to federal, state and private vendors. We need these supplies in place by April 5th. This is critical.
731	2020-04-01 23:52:37+00:00	The deadline our city HAS to hit for more personnel, supplies and equipment is Sunday, April 5th. Here's the good news: We WILL have a sufficient supply of eye protection and surgical gloves for ALL hospitals by Sunday.
732	2020-04-01 23:52:37+00:00	Jimmy's tenure as NYPD Commissioner brought record lows in crime and forged bonds between police and communities. He loves this city and I'm honored to have him back. I also want to express my gratitude to Visa CEO Al Kelly for allowing him to do this crucial, lifesaving work
733	2020-04-01 23:52:36+00:00	I'm proud to announce Jimmy O'Neill is returning to help lead the fight against COVID-19. He'll be joining the team and system that will get people on the front lines what they need, when they need it. I can't think of a better person for the job than Jimmy.
734	2020-04-01 21:51:54+00:00	Reverend, I know just how hard a call this was for you to make and what this season means to so many of our fellow New Yorkers. Your foresight and leadership are a testament to your faith.
735	2020-04-01 20:12:22+00:00	Join us at City Hall for the latest updates on New York City’s response to COVID-19.
736	2020-04-01 19:22:18+00:00	We’re seeing just how critical federal resources are for our city and state, and that’s why it’s so important that everyone take ten minutes today to fill out the Census. Head to http://my2020census.gov and #GetCountedNYC!
737	2020-04-01 13:29:14+00:00	We’re creating new hospitals in some of the most unexpected places. Join the conversation. Use the hashtag #AskMyMayor.
738	2020-04-01 01:47:20+00:00	.@FDNY firefighters have gotten a major fire at an apartment building on the Grand Concourse under control. We’re so grateful for their valiant efforts. Several people are in critical condition. We’re praying for them and their families tonight.
739	2020-03-31 23:39:18+00:00	Even during the most challenging times, New York City remains a beacon of hope, inclusion and acceptance. To our trans community who are no strangers to struggle, know that we have your back. We see you, stand with you and will fight for you. Always. #TransDayOfVisibility
740	2020-03-31 22:39:08+00:00	Women are on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. They are saving lives, keeping our city running and yet they are not making as much as their male counterparts. We need to END the gender wage gap and we need to end it NOW. #EqualPayDay
741	2020-03-31 21:15:25+00:00	I am truly inspired by the people stepping up during this crisis. That speaks to what New Yorkers do all the time. The attitude that we will overcome anything and everything is on display across our city right now and THAT makes me proud.
742	2020-03-31 21:15:25+00:00	Some good news: Alternate Side Parking is SUSPENDED for the next two weeks, through Tuesday, April 14th. Leave your cars where they are, it's one less reason to go out during this trying time.
743	2020-03-31 21:15:24+00:00	I know parents need outlets for their kids but if we see unsafe behavior we’ll have to shut locations down.
744	2020-03-31 21:15:24+00:00	For the most part, we're seeing compliance when it comes to social distancing in our playgrounds, but we have seen a few trouble spots, and I've ordered those ten playgrounds to be closed today.
745	2020-03-31 21:15:24+00:00	Update on our Corrections Department: 900 detainees have now been released. Our focus continues to be releasing elderly people and those with chronic health conditions. We are working with the State and DAs to ensure this is done safely.
746	2020-03-31 21:15:24+00:00	The sheriff's office is also investigating to ensure social distancing is observed. There WILL be penalties for any violations.
747	2020-03-31 21:15:23+00:00	I’ve directed @NYCCHR to launch an investigation into allegations that an Amazon worker on Staten Island was fired for raising health and safety concerns.
748	2020-03-31 21:15:23+00:00	.@NYCHealthSystem contracted 500 more nurses last week and planned to add 500 more this week. On top of that they’re bringing in 1,000 more later in April.
749	2020-03-31 21:15:23+00:00	Thanks to our partnership with @FEMA, 250 more ambulances and 500 more paramedics and EMTs are coming to our city. 139 of those ambulances and 270 of those personnel are already on the ground.
750	2020-03-31 21:15:22+00:00	Before this crisis, all hospitals combined had 20,000 staffed beds. We have to dramatically increase that—and quickly. Places like the Tennis Center hospital will help us meet that demand and we'll keep fighting every single day to build more of them across the city.
751	2020-03-31 21:15:22+00:00	The tennis center will have 350 beds, with all the staffing needed. Patients will come from Elmhurst Hospital, immediately reliving the enormous pressure they've been facing. It’ll receive its first patients next week.
752	2020-03-31 21:15:22+00:00	We're transforming the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center into a hospital to help combat COVID-19. I look forward to the day it will be a place for tennis again — but I'm so inspired by the team here for stepping up immediately to help us get this done.
753	2020-03-31 18:28:58+00:00	Join us at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens for updates on the COVID-19 crisis.
754	2020-03-31 13:11:55+00:00	We’re the largest city in the nation — but sometimes it’s felt like we’re fighting the COVID-19 crisis alone. That changed yesterday. Join me to talk about the USNS Comfort and answer more of your questions. #AskMyMayor
755	2020-03-31 02:05:20+00:00	The USNS Comfort has arrived — and just in time. These have been scary times for New Yorkers and I want to thank the @USNavy for reminding us that our city is not alone in this fight.
756	2020-03-31 00:23:34+00:00	Our educators have done something that’s never been tried before. They’re teaching over one million @NYCSchools students remotely. It’s taken immense flexibility, patience and dedication — but we’ll do anything to educate our kids.
757	2020-03-30 21:19:43+00:00	Now more than ever we’re recognizing the heroism of our health care workers. On this #NationalDoctorsDay we honor them — and we’ll keep doing everything we can to support them in the battles to come.
758	2020-03-30 17:58:10+00:00	The toughest weeks of this crisis are, unfortunately, still ahead. We need our nation to stand by us. And when the battle is done here, we'll be the first to send aid to the rest of the nation. Wherever the need is greatest, New York City will be there for our fellow Americans.
759	2020-03-30 17:58:10+00:00	We also thank the President, Defense Secretary Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Milley, and the men and women of the @USNavy, @USMC, @USCG, and @FEMA for their work. But we can't stress this enough: we need more help from the federal government.
760	2020-03-30 17:58:10+00:00	On September 11th, 2001 former FDNY Commissioner Tom Von Essen helped lead our firefighters through our city’s darkest day. We’re lucky to have him where he is as our regional administrator for FEMA.
761	2020-03-30 17:58:08+00:00	There are so many people to thank for the USNS Comfort's arrival, but I want to take a moment to celebrate two of our own. I’m proud to say Rear Admiral John Mustin and his family call Manhattan home. He's a true savior for our city in this moment.
762	2020-03-30 17:58:07+00:00	The Comfort will make a real difference in this fight. It’s as if a full hospital just sailed to our harbor and opened its doors. Medical personnel and 750 more hospital beds will now get to work saving lives.
763	2020-03-30 17:58:06+00:00	The USNS Comfort is a beacon of hope. Help has arrived in New York City.
764	2020-03-30 15:44:12+00:00	We just got some major reinforcements in the COVID-19 fight — the @USNavy’s Comfort has arrived in New York City.
765	2020-03-30 13:03:22+00:00	It’s tough to be a parent anytime but the COVID-19 crisis is posing new challenges for our families. What is your city doing to help? We dig into that and answer your questions. #AskMyMayor
766	2020-03-29 23:40:03+00:00	It’s a jarring time. Our city is changing around us. Streets are empty, stores are closed. The city is quieter than ever. But that’s a sign New Yorkers are doing their part to protect themselves and their neighbors. This won't be easy, but we will get through this together.
767	2020-03-29 23:40:03+00:00	On Monday, the USNS Comfort Navy Hospital will arrive in New York Harbor. It will be a welcome sight. We're so grateful to the Navy and all of the military personnel coming to our city to help New Yorkers in our time of need.
768	2020-03-29 23:40:03+00:00	We’re adding hospital beds, too. You’ll see an unusual sight in Central Park. We’re working with Mt. Sinai to open a field hospital in Central Park's East Meadow. And new beds at the Coler Center on Roosevelt Island have already started receiving patients.
769	2020-03-29 23:40:03+00:00	We’ve just brought in 500 contract nurses and trained personnel to @NYCHealthSystem hospitals and another 500 are on the way. This will help relieve some of the enormous pressure our public hospital staff have been under these past two weeks.
770	2020-03-29 23:40:02+00:00	The team at @NYCHealthSystem's Elmhurst Hospital has shown such extraordinary strength. We are doing everything we can to back them up. We've sent 169 clinicians and 100 more nurses, and will continue moving personnel there to meet the crisis head-on.
771	2020-03-29 23:40:02+00:00	I spoke with President Trump this morning about our need for more ventilators and medical personnel. This is going to be a tough week. We’re girding for it and surging staff and supplies to our front line hospitals. But we continue to need serious federal help to hold the line.
772	2020-03-29 20:17:52+00:00	Join us at City Hall with the latest on New York City's response to COVID-19.
773	2020-03-29 13:00:00+00:00	We’re at war and ventilators are our ammunition. Join me to talk about how we keep supplies going to the front lines and answer questions from @salma1680, Colleen from Washington Heights and @AmazeByEric. Use the hashtag #AskMyMayor to keep your questions coming, NYC!
774	2020-03-28 21:43:44+00:00	Today we grieve along with the families of Detective Cedric Dixon, City Custodian Dennis Dickson and Administrative Assistant Giacomina Barr-Brown. Our thoughts are also with the NYPD, who continue to keep us safe and protected during this crisis.
775	2020-03-28 17:34:38+00:00	This is horrifying. My heart breaks for this woman and for her family. We WILL find the person responsible for this heinous crime and bring them to justice. New York City stands with our trans community, now and always.
776	2020-03-28 15:01:27+00:00	RIGHT NOW we’re shipping another 1,400 ventilators to the New York City hospitals that need them most. Ventilators SAVE lives.
777	2020-03-28 13:00:10+00:00	.@DougSlawin asks when a plan will be announced to freeze rent. I think the time to do that is NOW. But what can New York City do to make that a reality? We'll talk about that and answer @bereitedich and @ReclusiveRacer's questions on today's Message From the Mayor. #AskMyMayor
778	2020-03-28 01:53:09+00:00	This week has been challenging for all of us. The sad truth remains this will still get worse before it gets better. But we have seen New Yorkers at their best this week and I know you'll continue to meet this moment. Keep informed — text COVID to 692692 for real-time updates.
779	2020-03-28 01:53:09+00:00	I want to salute some real unsung heroes. More than 750 clinicians are staffing 311 day and night and they've answered 23,000 calls this week alone. They're doing crucial work, providing sound advice and support to New Yorkers. Their city applauds them for their efforts.
780	2020-03-28 01:53:08+00:00	For the handful who haven’t, it's my sad duty to say that if you hold large gatherings at a house of worship this weekend, we will have to enforce the rules for everyone’s safety.
781	2020-03-28 01:53:08+00:00	I want to thank religious leaders from all faiths who protected their congregations by suspending in-person services.
782	2020-03-28 01:53:08+00:00	The vast majority of New Yorkers are practicing social distancing, but we've seen some concerning cases of non-compliance. Let me say this as clearly as I can: we DON'T want to issue fines. But this weekend will decide whether tougher measures are needed to protect everyone.
783	2020-03-28 01:53:07+00:00	So far, we’ve released 375 detainees and by tonight that number will be at least 450. We want to protect people in our custody and also protect communities across the city.
784	2020-03-28 01:53:07+00:00	An update on our jails: We are continuing to release people at risk from COVID-19 who we believe do not pose a safety risk.
785	2020-03-28 01:53:07+00:00	We know working families are feeling the economic fallout right now. If ever there was a time for a rent freeze, this is it. We’ll work with the State to suspend the Rent Guidelines Board process for 2020, freezing rents on more than a million rent-stabilized apartments.
786	2020-03-28 01:53:07+00:00	The President knows Elmhurst Hospital. He knows the neighborhood around it. I asked @realDonaldTrump to keep Elmhurst in his mind as he makes decisions. Let that be the touchstone that moves you to maximize efforts immediately.
787	2020-03-28 01:53:06+00:00	I applaud the President for invoking the Defense Protection Act but I urge him to go much further to mobilize whole industries across America to make ventilators and other supplies. The federal government has sent us 2,500 ventilators, which helps a lot. But we need 15,000.
788	2020-03-28 01:53:06+00:00	To anyone who says we need to get back to normal and begin an economic recovery: there can’t be a recovery when people are dying, when our health care system is pushed to the breaking point, when state and local governments are in crisis. The recovery begins when the crisis ends.
789	2020-03-28 01:53:06+00:00	On behalf of their city, I offer our condolences to the families of these loyal public servants.
790	2020-03-28 01:53:06+00:00	We feel it at City Hall, too, as we’ve lost fellow public servants. We lost a principal, a custodian at police headquarters, and workers from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Corrections.
791	2020-03-28 01:53:05+00:00	We remain the epicenter of this crisis. We have 26,697 cases and we've lost 450 of our neighbors. Every one of us knows a health care worker on the front lines or a person struggling with this illness.
792	2020-03-28 01:53:04+00:00	Sunday, April 5th. That’s the day I tried to fix in the mind of @realDonaldTrump when we spoke earlier today. That’s the day the strains we’re seeing right now on medical supplies and personnel could overwhelm us if we don’t get the help we need. This is a race against time.
793	2020-03-27 23:31:19+00:00	.@mattyigreene asked a great question this week on #AskMyMayor about why nonessential construction is still happening. Today the answer is: it’s not. Any construction that's not part of fighting COVID-19 or keeping the city running will end as soon as it is safe to do so.
794	2020-03-27 21:00:28+00:00	Join us at City Hall for the latest updates on the fight against COVID-19 in New York City.
795	2020-03-27 18:26:27+00:00	It feels like there aren’t enough words to express how we feel about the heroes working at @NYCHealthSystem and all our hospitals to save lives in this crisis. But the community just left a message across the street from Elmhurst Hospital with the two words we need:
796	2020-03-27 18:09:14+00:00	I want to thank General Todd Semonite for coming to New York City to personally oversee the US Army Corps of Engineers deployment. VERY productive meeting with his team last night. We’re in a wartime scenario and our city is grateful to have them in the trenches with us.
797	2020-03-27 17:45:31+00:00	The doctors and nurses at Elmhurst Hospital are giving it their all right now. We’re laser-focused on keeping them supplied with what they need. Yesterday we sent more ventilators and staff. Today, we sent 8,000 N95 masks, 18,000 head covers and 2,000 booties. More is on the way.
798	2020-03-27 16:36:21+00:00	Tomorrow these same trucks are going out again with 800,000 more N95 masks, 2 million more surgical masks and hundreds more ventilators.
799	2020-03-27 16:36:20+00:00	*Right now* there are 20 trucks on the road delivering protective equipment to New York City hospitals. They’re carrying: • 1 million surgical masks • 200,000 N95 masks • 50,000 face shields • 40,000 isolation gowns • 10,000 boxes of gloves
800	2020-03-27 15:49:59+00:00	This morning we shipped out hundreds more ventilators to our hard-hit New York City hospitals, including @NYCHealthSystem. To the doctors, nurses and health care workers on the front lines: we’re moving fast to get you everything you need to save lives.
801	2020-03-27 15:21:45+00:00	Our mass transit workers are helping hold this city together in this perilous moment. We stand with them today. Our prayers are with the family of the worker we lost and for a speedy recovery for everyone injured in the fire.
802	2020-03-27 15:21:45+00:00	We mourn the transit worker we lost in today’s train fire at the Central Park North station and we thank the @FDNY for their valiant work. A full investigation into this is underway by the NYPD and FDNY.
803	2020-03-27 13:35:19+00:00	Yesterday I saw something amazing at @BklynNavyYard that's going to save lives. We'll talk more about it and get the answers to questions from @Krugerio, @JordanaLevin and @EminaHRW on today's Message From The Mayor. Use #AskMyMayor to send us your questions!
804	2020-03-27 12:48:52+00:00	It only took four days to turn an empty building in Brooklyn into a wartime factory producing life-saving face masks for our hospitals. Never bet against the strength and creativity of New Yorkers. If you can make supplies, we need you — head to http://nyc.gov/covidsuppliers.
805	2020-03-27 11:02:07+00:00	I spoke with @elonmusk late last night. He’s donating hundreds of ventilators to New York City and State, including our public hospitals. We’re deeply grateful. We need every ventilator we can get our hands on these next few weeks to save lives.
806	2020-03-27 01:47:57+00:00	We could not be prouder of Brooklyn's own @SenSchumer leading the fight in Washington. Of course there's more to work to do to fight the COVID-19 crisis, but his tireless efforts with the CARES Act got us badly needed relief for our small businesses and working families.
807	2020-03-26 23:21:22+00:00	To our health care workers: you are going above and beyond the call to save New Yorkers and we will remember your actions for the rest of New York history. We will not rest until you have the supplies you need. On behalf of 8.6 million New Yorkers, we are grateful for you.
808	2020-03-26 23:21:21+00:00	We're dealing with an unprecedented crisis in New York City. We are losing people every day. There are now 23,112 COVID-19 cases in New York City and 365 deaths. The next few months will be painful and stress our health care system like never before.
809	2020-03-26 23:21:21+00:00	I’m asking grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential businesses across the city to consider reserving special senior hours. I think all New Yorkers want to make sure our seniors are safe and get what they need.
810	2020-03-26 23:21:21+00:00	Our city jail population is now 4,906. That’s the fewest detainees we’ve had in our jails since 1949. By tonight, the number of inmates released in response to the COVID-19 crisis will go from 200 up to 375. We will continue to address this in the safest way possible.
811	2020-03-26 23:21:21+00:00	We’ve received nearly 1,500 so far from the federal government. That's a fraction of what we will eventually need. The federal government MUST help us close that gap.
812	2020-03-26 23:20:35+00:00	Ventilators will mean the difference between life and death for thousands of New Yorkers. They're the essential piece of this puzzle.
813	2020-03-26 23:20:34+00:00	We have the BEST public hospitals in the nation, but they’re under tremendous strain right now. Our entire health care system needs to grow rapidly. Our goal is to triple the number of hospital beds by May.
814	2020-03-26 23:20:34+00:00	Thank you to @setwrights of Bednark Studios, Michael Duggal of @DuggalGH and @BklynNavyYard for stepping up. And to all the doctors, nurses and health care workers on the front lines: your whole city is moving heaven and earth to get you what you need.
815	2020-03-26 23:20:33+00:00	Four days. That’s how long it took the Brooklyn Navy Yard to take an idea to manufacture plastic face shields for medical personnel and turn it into reality. Now they’re being made by the thousands. 50,000 by the end of this week alone.
816	2020-03-26 20:52:09+00:00	We’re at City Hall with the latest on New York City’s response to COVID-19.
817	2020-03-26 18:21:50+00:00	Right now Elmhurst hospital is holding its own, but we are in a race against time and we need more federal help IMMEDIATELY. We have to continue pushing vital supplies to Elmhurst and other frontline hospitals so they can save lives.
818	2020-03-26 18:21:50+00:00	The staff are giving their all to save every patient, but tragically this disease continues to take a terrible toll on the most vulnerable. To the men and women working at Elmhurst right now: your city sees you, your city thanks you and more help is on the way.
819	2020-03-26 18:21:50+00:00	We’ve moved in 40 more ventilators and added more staff to increase capacity. Yesterday Elmhurst was running nearly three times the number of ICU beds than usual.
820	2020-03-26 18:21:49+00:00	Elmhurst hospital is at the center of responding to this crisis. It’s the number one priority of our public hospital system right now. The staff on the frontlines are going above and beyond. We’re doing everything we can to get them what they need.
821	2020-03-26 13:28:52+00:00	You asked, and I answered — find out what the hell social distancing actually means. Use the hashtag #AskMyMayor to keep your questions coming, New York City!
822	2020-03-26 00:53:32+00:00	It’s easy to feel alone, but I guarantee that you're not. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are working to protect you. There are a lot of heroes in this city, rising to the challenge. That's what we do in New York City. We will get through this together.
823	2020-03-26 00:53:31+00:00	Social distancing is taking hold with New Yorkers — but we're seeing some issues when it comes to basketball courts. If you want to go shoot hoops with your kids, that's fine. But we can't have pick-up games. If people don’t follow the rules, we’ll take hoops down.
824	2020-03-26 00:53:31+00:00	Beginning Friday we'll expand free childcare to cover grocery and pharmacy workers, more Health Department staff, essential workers at Probation and Environmental Protection, and Staten Island Ferry and NYC Ferry workers. We know you’re working hard. Your city is here to help.
825	2020-03-26 00:53:31+00:00	We will be expanding criteria for Regional Enrichment Centers so we can provide education and childcare to more families. Currently the children of health care, first responders and transit workers are eligible.
826	2020-03-26 00:53:31+00:00	I again thank @SpeakerPelosi, @SenSchumer and our Congressional delegation for fighting for us. They took the lead in getting unemployment assistance, grants to small businesses and direct cash to families.
827	2020-03-26 00:53:30+00:00	We have 1/3 of the COVID-19 cases in the country but NYC is getting less than 1% of the $150 billion pool for states and cities. The math doesn't add up. One person stood in the way of aid reaching New Yorkers: @SenateMajldr Mitch McConnell. We'll fight for every cent we're owed.
828	2020-03-26 00:53:30+00:00	We also need the President to FULLY use the Defense Production Act and mobilize the military. We're seeing SOME military presence, and that's a positive sign. But we need more. I don't see how supplies get where they need to go to save lives without the military.
829	2020-03-26 00:53:30+00:00	We now have 400 ventilators from FEMA with 2,000 coming by the end of the week. Those WILL buy us time. But we need 15,000 — and we need them FAST. Only the federal government can get this done.
830	2020-03-26 00:53:29+00:00	Let me be blunt about this crisis: it won't be better by Easter. We can't let our guard down and cling to false hope. April will be tougher than March and May will be even tougher.
831	2020-03-25 21:49:52+00:00	I’m at City Hall with updates on the COVID-19 crisis. Join us now:
832	2020-03-25 19:20:09+00:00	This war is not ending today. It’s not ending tomorrow. We’ll be fighting this virus for months, and fighting its fallout for years to come. We will be here picking up the pieces, but we cannot do it alone.
833	2020-03-25 19:19:35+00:00	Direct cash to families, grants to small businesses and extended unemployment benefits are huge improvements. I want to thank Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi for ensuring this vital aid was part of this package.
834	2020-03-25 19:18:45+00:00	At the same time, I want to recognize the help in this bill for working families and small businesses who are struggling to pay bills.
835	2020-03-25 19:18:12+00:00	Costs are rapidly mounting while our revenues are falling sharply. Sending us $1 billion out of a $150 billion pot does not reflect reality. We need immediate action for our people.
836	2020-03-25 19:17:37+00:00	More than anything, we need direct aid to our City that ensures we can maintain care in our hospitals and basic services for 8.6 million people.
837	2020-03-25 19:16:57+00:00	We have over 15,000 cases, have lost nearly 200 lives already, and our hospitals are days away from running out of supplies. Businesses are shuttering and people are registering for unemployment at unprecedented rates.
838	2020-03-25 19:16:13+00:00	NYC is the epicenter of this crisis. No place is hurting more. No place needs help more urgently. The direct aid to localities in the stimulus bill coming out of Mitch McConnell’s Senate is nowhere close to what we need to fight this epidemic in the nation’s largest city.
839	2020-03-25 16:05:48+00:00	As COVID-19 gripped our city, New Yorkers rolled up their sleeves and got to work fighting back. We’re mobilizing factories across the five boroughs to produce vital supplies for the front lines.
840	2020-03-25 13:18:26+00:00	The world we knew a few short weeks ago won’t be back for a long time. But your city is still here for you. Send your questions, comments and concerns about COVID-19 using the hashtag #AskMyMayor. I’ll be here every morning to bring you the answers.
841	2020-03-25 01:28:23+00:00	Go to http://nyc.gov and click on “Produce or Donate Supplies” on the homepage. We’ll rapidly get your help to the front lines.
842	2020-03-25 01:28:22+00:00	If you have a single ventilator you can get to New York City, if you have N95 masks, face shields, gowns, ANYTHING that can aid in this fight, we need it.
843	2020-03-25 01:28:22+00:00	I also want to applaud @Merck for sending us face masks, @societegenerale for surgical masks and @AmericanExpress and @LouisVuitton for sending vital N95 respirator masks. Thank you for stepping up when our need is greatest.
844	2020-03-25 01:28:22+00:00	We’re seeing more and more individuals and philanthropies come forward to help. Last night I spoke to Mike Roman, CEO of @3M, and I want to thank him and his team for coming forward to give our city crucial supplies to confront this crisis.
845	2020-03-25 01:28:22+00:00	I’ve spoken about ventilators to both President Trump and Peter Navarro at the White House this week. We thank them for the first 400 ventilators that came in yesterday and for pledging thousands more today. This is good news.
846	2020-03-25 01:28:21+00:00	This is a tough moment for our city. But New Yorkers aren’t alone in this fight. I want to express my sincere thanks to the State, to the federal agencies setting up here in NYC, and to the private sector partners answering the call.
847	2020-03-25 01:01:32+00:00	Stay in the know. Text COVID to 692-692 or visit http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for the latest.
848	2020-03-25 01:01:32+00:00	It’s critical that our essential workers have the transportation they need to keep our City running. Thank you to @CitiBikeNYC for offering a FREE 30-day membership to these crucial workers.
849	2020-03-25 01:01:31+00:00	We are working with the City Council to start opening a limited number of streets to pedestrians, joggers and cyclists on Thursday. The streets selected will be based on where there's the greatest need while also guaranteeing the NYPD will be able to enforce proper distancing.
850	2020-03-25 01:01:31+00:00	Some good news to report: the streets have been kept clean with folks socially isolating, so we will suspend Alternate Side Parking for an additional seven days, through Tuesday, March 31st. We will continue to look at the situation week by week, to ensure our streets stay clean.
851	2020-03-25 01:01:31+00:00	The NYPD are explaining and enforcing the new social distancing rules at parks and playgrounds. With warmer days coming, we need people to understand: if they don’t follow the rules, we’ll have little choice but to shut down spaces like playgrounds. We’ll assess on Saturday.
852	2020-03-25 01:01:31+00:00	There are approximately 300 people with misdemeanors and non-violent felonies that I’m going to move to release immediately. For those that fall outside my jurisdiction, I am alerting the State and District Attorneys to my concerns.
853	2020-03-25 01:01:31+00:00	We’re making important decisions about our City jails. No one over 70 or with pre-existing conditions should be in our jail system right now and we are working to make that a reality.
854	2020-03-25 01:01:30+00:00	We’re making hard decisions about our City budget right now. I’ve asked OMB to initiate a PEG program immediately and I want to affirm that today. The goal will be to cut at least $1.3 billion and the process has already begun at all agencies. COVID-19 response will NOT be cut.
855	2020-03-25 01:01:30+00:00	We heard today that the Defense Protection Act was activated for the first time. We MUST get production increased immediately. I’m pleased the DPA is finally being used, now we have to use it a LOT more.
856	2020-03-25 01:01:30+00:00	We need enormous help, and nothing is more important than ventilators. Something is deeply wrong when there are ventilators sitting in federal warehouses when New Yorkers are at risk. If a ventilator isn’t readily available, someone in respiratory distress can die in minutes.
857	2020-03-25 01:01:30+00:00	We now have 15,597 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City. We are this country’s epicenter, and we need federal help consistent with the challenges we’re facing.
858	2020-03-25 01:01:29+00:00	I hear people like the President talk about getting back to work, getting back to normal in a few weeks. Normal won’t be possible if our health care system is being overwhelmed and lives are being lost.
859	2020-03-25 01:01:28+00:00	We expect the fight against COVID-19 to be a long one. I wish that wasn't the case for New York City, but right now we are looking at months. We expect April to be tougher than March, and May to be tougher still.
860	2020-03-24 20:02:14+00:00	Join me at City Hall for the latest on New York City’s response to the COVID-19 crisis.
861	2020-03-24 02:23:00+00:00	Ten years ago, the cause of universal health care took a huge step forward when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. A decade later, in the midst of a global pandemic, we're reminded that health care is a human right — one we must protect and expand to ALL Americans.
862	2020-03-24 01:43:11+00:00	Your city is taking every action possible to address this crisis. We will help each other and we will support each other through this. We're in this together.
863	2020-03-24 01:43:11+00:00	To New Yorkers with disabilities — I know you feel the stress of this crisis deeply. We're focused on getting you the support you need. Go to @NYCDisabilities, 311 or http://nyc.gov/disability for more information. Deaf New Yorkers can connect via video phone at 646-396-5830.
864	2020-03-24 01:43:11+00:00	By Wednesday we will decide on the next 100-200 people. We want to do this smartly and safely.
865	2020-03-24 01:43:10+00:00	75 people with very limited time left on their sentences have been released from Rikers Island. We’re making final decisions on another 200 candidates for potential release this evening.
866	2020-03-24 01:43:10+00:00	We will NOT cut spending relating to COVID-19 response, but every agency will be asked to contribute.
867	2020-03-24 01:43:10+00:00	Because of this crisis, we're going to have to make tough decisions when it comes to the City budget. I've directed our budget office to institute a PEG (Program to Eliminate the Gap) for City agencies.
868	2020-03-24 01:43:10+00:00	I want to thank companies that have stepped up. ASO Corporation, American Express and Merck have sent masks. Voice Tech, Bed Narc Studios, Makerspace and Adafruit have agreed to make tens of thousands of face shields right here in New York City. This will help save lives.
869	2020-03-24 01:43:08+00:00	Additional help is coming from the federal and state government. We're also getting supplies from private companies, charities and by making our own.
870	2020-03-24 01:43:08+00:00	Today we distributed supplies to hospitals across the city, including 200,000 N95 masks, 2 million surgical masks and 70,000 face shields.
871	2020-03-24 01:43:08+00:00	We NEED the military's help in New York City. We can't say this enough. The USNS Comfort will be on its way — but we will need SO much more going forward in terms of logistics, manpower and supplies.
872	2020-03-24 01:43:07+00:00	A surge in hospital capacity is underway. New beds will come online at @NYCHealthSystem’s Coler Center on Roosevelt Island this week. We will have 1,000 new beds at the Javits Center thanks to the Army Corps of Engineers, @NYCEmergencyMgt, FEMA and the State of New York.
873	2020-03-24 01:43:07+00:00	We saw some signs of help on the way. 400 ventilators from the federal stockpile came in today. Our need is in the thousands, but it's a race against time and this will buy us critical days.
874	2020-03-24 01:43:07+00:00	I spoke last night with @realDonaldTrump and @VP about the reality of our public hospitals. It was a substantive conversation, and I made clear the seriousness of what we’re facing in New York City, and the vital need for immediate help.
875	2020-03-23 21:15:58+00:00	I'm at City Hall with updates on New York City's response to COVID-19.
876	2020-03-23 20:20:17+00:00	The NUMBER ONE thing you can do in the fight against COVID-19? STAY HOME. The more New Yorkers stay inside, the fewer chances the virus has to spread — and the fewer people with the virus, the more our health care system can fight this crisis. More: http://nyc.gov/coronavirus
877	2020-03-23 15:22:45+00:00	Lloyd, we’re losing dozens of lives to COVID-19 on a daily basis and we're only at the beginning of this crisis. And people “with a lower risk” are still at a high risk to spread the virus. The more people stay home, the more lives we save. That’s all that matters.
878	2020-03-23 13:17:49+00:00	If you’re young and healthy, don’t just stay home for your own sake. Do it to protect your parents, grandparents and loved ones who would be at serious risk if they caught COVID-19. Stay home. Practice social distancing. Flatten the curve. Save lives.
879	2020-03-22 22:53:35+00:00	We’re facing another week of the unknown. But we’ll confront it with the same grit that New Yorkers do every time we have a challenge. We’ll get through this together. Stay informed: text COVID to 692692 or visit http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more.
880	2020-03-22 22:53:35+00:00	Please donate blood — call 1-800-933-2566 to find a location near you.
881	2020-03-22 22:53:34+00:00	I've heard from New Yorkers looking to do more to help, and here's one way you can contribute: Right now we are losing many of the blood drives we count on due to businesses closing down. Donating blood will be considered essential travel.
882	2020-03-22 22:53:34+00:00	Also in today: bike repair shops *are* essential businesses. They will be able to remain open and serve everyone who depends on a bike to get where they need to go during the COVID-19 crisis.
883	2020-03-22 22:53:34+00:00	23 inmates are being released today. We have an additional 200 being evaluated right now for release who have less than 90 days left in their sentences. Our focus is doing this safely and with the right supervision after release.
884	2020-03-22 22:53:34+00:00	For everyone concerned with the situation at our jails: we are, too.
885	2020-03-22 22:53:33+00:00	City government is changing to meet the COVID-19 crisis head-on. We've named new czars to oversee food supply & distribution and coordinate relief efforts with the private sector. Long-time public servants have been elevated to lead our response:
886	2020-03-22 22:53:33+00:00	I am desperately concerned there are a lot of New Yorkers running out of the money they use to buy food. We're building a citywide network to make sure food is available for those who cannot afford it. It will take a mobilization we've never seen before in New York City.
887	2020-03-22 22:53:33+00:00	Yesterday we did 13,000 inspections of bars, restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and other businesses. Agencies only had to issue 11 violations for not complying with new rules. That's how seriously New Yorkers are taking this.
888	2020-03-22 22:53:33+00:00	Stay with your kids. Watch out for them and make sure they maintain distance from others. Take this seriously.
889	2020-03-22 22:53:33+00:00	For right now, playgrounds are still open. We’ll keep them that way so long as we see families using them responsibly. That means we don’t want crowds or people close together.
890	2020-03-22 22:53:32+00:00	We’ve barred organized sports and big gatherings in our @NYCParks. If you need to get outside, get outside and our parks will be open. But use them for solo recreation, and try to keep six feet of space between yourself and others. Go, get your exercise, and then GO HOME.
891	2020-03-22 22:53:32+00:00	Starting tonight at 8pm we will implement the Governor “PAUSE” order on social distancing. Go out to the grocery store or to the pharmacy or to get some exercise, but DO NOT linger. Get back home. We won’t be draconian but we will enforce this new reality.
892	2020-03-22 22:53:32+00:00	At the same time, I could not be MORE inspired by the generosity and resolve of the people of our city. No one on Earth is better prepared for a crisis than a New Yorker.
893	2020-03-22 22:53:32+00:00	As this crisis mounts, so does our anger at the lack of federal response. We're glad FEMA is here, but we need supplies and need them now. Governor Cuomo announced a million more N95 masks are coming to New York City. We've seen no such specifics from President Trump.
894	2020-03-22 22:53:32+00:00	People over 70 make up 10% of our total population but 35% of our COVID-19 hospitalizations. We can’t stress enough the risks older people with underlying medical problems face right now. Protect them by keeping them out of physical contact with others as much as possible.
895	2020-03-22 22:53:31+00:00	We're on the verge of 10,000 cases of COVID-19 in New York City. We've had 63 deaths. We represent 1/3 of the cases in the US and 2/3 of the cases in New York State. This crisis is affecting our entire nation and New York City is its epicenter.
896	2020-03-22 18:58:17+00:00	Join us at City Hall with important updates on New York City's response to COVID-19.
897	2020-03-21 20:33:08+00:00	As of Sunday night at 8PM, we will enforce Governor Cuomo's Executive Order. Do your part New York: STAY HOME.
898	2020-03-21 19:19:19+00:00	Small businesses in New York City are hurting. Your city is here to help. Visit http://nyc.gov/SBS for more information.
899	2020-03-21 16:49:46+00:00	This will really help the medical professionals and first responders on the front lines of this epidemic in New York City. Thank you @NYGovCuomo.
900	2020-03-21 16:00:10+00:00	You can help stop the spread of COVID-19 right now: STAY HOME. Your social distancing can save lives. Do your part, New York City.
901	2020-03-21 12:40:07+00:00	On Tuesday we asked health care professionals who have already given so much of their lives for our city to step up once again — and more than 2,000 of them have already stepped forward. Join this fight. Save your fellow New Yorkers. Go to http://nyc.gov/helpnownyc for more.
902	2020-03-21 00:22:33+00:00	Please continue to monitor your own health. Please, stay home and stay safe. Go to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus and text COVID to 692-692 for real-time updates from @NotifyNYC.
903	2020-03-21 00:22:33+00:00	If you’re out there and feel confused or anxious, you’re not alone. All of us are trying to make sense of this. But New Yorkers are a tough people by nature, and that’s something that makes us proud. Let’s depend on that strength — and our ability to help each other.
904	2020-03-21 00:22:33+00:00	We’re also partnering with @DoorDash to get food to the homes of medically fragile students. No child will go hungry. Not on our watch.
905	2020-03-21 00:22:33+00:00	Beginning Monday, 435 sites will be open for Grab-and-Go breakfast, lunch AND dinner for children. Any child under 18 is eligible. None will be turned away.
906	2020-03-21 00:22:32+00:00	On Monday we will open 93 enrichment centers to take care of the children of our essential workers in this crisis. Thank you to @NYCSchools, educators and staff for stepping up and doing something that has never been done before in the history of our city.
907	2020-03-21 00:22:32+00:00	New York City is now at the epicenter of this crisis. As of today, we have 1/3 of cases in the country and 2/3 of those in New York State. We are the front.
908	2020-03-21 00:22:32+00:00	The NYPD will help us enforce this order by working with supermarkets, pharmacies and other essential services to make sure social distancing happens. They'll also be helping us educate the public on the risk of being outside for too long.
909	2020-03-21 00:22:32+00:00	Beginning Sunday at 8 PM, @NYGovCuomo's order goes into effect and it’s simple: STAY INSIDE. ALL non-essential workers should stay home. This doesn't apply to essential workers like the people keeping our grocery stores, food deliveries, mass transit and health systems running.
910	2020-03-21 00:22:30+00:00	Do your part. We need you to REALLY limit the people you come in contact with. Anything non-essential MUST be postponed. If you need to go outside, practice social distancing and stay six feet apart from other people. Don’t linger, don’t be outside longer than necessary.
911	2020-03-21 00:22:30+00:00	I thank @NYGovCuomo for issuing his Executive Order. This WILL save lives. We have to sharply limit non-essential activity to flatten the curve and slow the spread of this pandemic. It's a race against time and every second is vital. New Yorkers, do your part: STAY HOME.
912	2020-03-20 23:44:37+00:00	Doctors, nurses, physician assistants: WE WANT YOU! Whether you are active or retired, your city needs you on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus. Join us at http://nyc.gov/helpnowNYC.
913	2020-03-20 21:35:48+00:00	We’re at City Hall with updates on New York City’s response to COVID-19.
914	2020-03-20 12:31:15+00:00	We’re facing the greatest crisis in generations. We need @realDonaldTrump to take action and save American lives before it’s too late.
915	2020-03-20 11:51:56+00:00	Thank you to our food service workers and all the school staff who have made sure our kids have been able to get meals this week. Grab-and-Go breakfast and lunch is available in the lobby of every @NYCSchools building from 7:30 AM to 1:30 PM.
916	2020-03-20 03:24:10+00:00	They knew. And instead of protecting the American people, they cashed out.
917	2020-03-20 00:51:12+00:00	You’ll never go wrong listening to @TrevorNoah. Our emergency rooms are for emergencies. If you feel sick, STAY HOME. Monitor your health for 3-4 days and call your doctor. Help us protect our hospitals and our fellow New Yorkers. Go to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more.
918	2020-03-20 00:06:08+00:00	Please continue to keep informed. Text COVID to 692-692 for real-time updates or go to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus. Remember: facts, not fear.
919	2020-03-20 00:06:08+00:00	Remember: the MOST at-risk people are senior citizens and those with chronic conditions like lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer or a weakened immune system. We NEED to take extraordinary measures to keep them safe. Stay home and practice social distancing.
920	2020-03-20 00:06:08+00:00	Never count out the extraordinary heart and soul of New Yorkers. Since Tuesday, 1,746 retired or inactive health care professionals heard the call and joined the fight against COVID-19. On behalf of your city, thank you. Please keep the help coming: http://nyc.gov/helpnownyc
921	2020-03-20 00:06:08+00:00	We have some good news to report: @NYCHealthSystem has greatly increased its testing capacity. There are 8 new sites at hospitals up and running, with more coming online quickly. These are by appointment only and we will be prioritizing the sickest and most vulnerable among us.
922	2020-03-20 00:06:07+00:00	To @RealDonaldTrump: time is running out to mobilize our military and federal government. We need the logistics, expertise and support of the United States military and we need it NOW.
923	2020-03-20 00:06:07+00:00	@SenSchumer is absolutely right: we need a Marshall Plan to support our public and private hospitals, to strengthen our workforce and to make strategic investments in the national stockpile and help us fight this extended crisis.
924	2020-03-20 00:06:07+00:00	I’m heartened that Congress passed an initial relief effort, but it’s only a first step. We need a huge relief bill to put money in the pockets of working people and help states and localities stabilize, especially when it comes to health care.
925	2020-03-20 00:06:06+00:00	Despite my tremendous confidence in our health care workers, I must be clear that we’re facing something we’ve never seen outside of wartime. The only thing comparable is the Great Depression.
926	2020-03-20 00:06:06+00:00	Anyone who feels we’re dealing with something we’ve never dealt with before is right. But my confidence in New Yorkers couldn’t be stronger. We have the finest health care professionals in the world. We’ll be asking a lot of them in the coming weeks and they continue to step up.
927	2020-03-19 20:31:24+00:00	Join us at City Hall for a briefing on New York City’s response to COVID-19.
928	2020-03-19 14:46:08+00:00	Stepping up for your city. Heeding the call for your neighbors. THIS is what it means to be a New Yorker. Thank you to the 1,000 health care workers who immediately answered our call for help. You’ll save lives in a time of crisis. Let's get to work.
929	2020-03-19 13:18:49+00:00	@elonmusk New York City is buying! Our country is facing a drastic shortage and we need ventilators ASAP — we will need thousands in this city over the next few weeks. We’re getting them as fast as we can but we could use your help! We’re reaching out to you directly.
930	2020-03-19 11:52:13+00:00	Attention, New York City health care workers: Your city needs YOU! We will get through the COVID-19 crisis but we need all hands on deck. Go to http://nyc.gov/helpnownyc for more on how you can join the fight.
931	2020-03-19 02:55:24+00:00	This is wartime, @realDonaldTrump. Let’s act like it.
932	2020-03-19 02:30:18+00:00	We need the US Military where they can save the most American lives and right now that’s places like New York City. And soon it’s going to be a lot of other places. Mr. President, give the order.
933	2020-03-19 02:30:18+00:00	The only force that can do that quickly and effectively is the US Military. They’re being sidelined when they should be called to the front. THIS is the front right now.
934	2020-03-19 02:30:17+00:00	President Trump has to mobilize the US Military to fully act in the Coronavirus situation. We need their first-rate medical teams. We need their logistical support. We need their ability to get supplies from factories to where they’re needed most.
935	2020-03-19 02:01:10+00:00	New Yorkers everywhere will be able to sleep just a little bit easier thanks to the efforts of @NYGovCuomo, Leader @AndreaSCousins, Speaker @CarlHeastie, Senator @JessicaRamos and Assemblymember Catherine Nolan.
936	2020-03-19 02:01:09+00:00	We have some good news to report: The State just passed the emergency COVID-19 paid sick leave bill. If you have to self-quarantine and cannot go to work, you deserve paid sick leave coverage. This bill will make that a reality for working New Yorkers.
937	2020-03-18 23:30:49+00:00	We could soon face an economic crisis more dire than any since the Great Depression. It’s going to take action on par with the New Deal to pull people back over the edge. Nothing less will do it.
938	2020-03-18 23:30:48+00:00	The coronavirus relief package, passed by the House and Senate, is a good first step. But with untold numbers of people seeing their livelihoods slip away, we’re going to need a lot more—and soon. Not just one-time checks but actual replacement of lost income on a massive scale.
939	2020-03-18 23:30:48+00:00	We need their help now more than ever. We’ve seen a sobering rise in COVID-19 cases today. There are 1,871 cases in New York City. We’ve lost 11 New Yorkers. We grieve with these families.
940	2020-03-18 23:30:48+00:00	When New York City needs help, New Yorkers step up. We’ve had more than 1,000 health care professionals sign up for the City’s medical reserve in just 24 hours! Thank you for answering the call. Let’s keep going: http://nyc.gov/helpnownyc
941	2020-03-18 21:07:29+00:00	This is going to help a lot of people who are hurting. Thanks to @SpeakerPelosi, @SenSchumer, @SenGillibrand and our NYC delegation we're finally seeing some federal relief. We’ll need a lot more help as this crisis grows and it’s vital we focus that aid on working families.
942	2020-03-18 19:40:28+00:00	JUST IN: @NYCSchools served 133K grab-and-go meals to students today! Thank you to our @NYCSchools staff, especially our food service workers and managers, for taking good care of our kids. Get meals at the main entrance of ANY school from 7:30 AM to 1:30 PM!
943	2020-03-18 15:43:23+00:00	If you're a health care worker, your city needs YOU! We’re activating the 9,000 members of the Medical Reserve Corps and calling on anyone with medical training to join us. You can help us save lives and protect this city. Head to http://nyc.gov/helpnownyc to join this fight.
944	2020-03-18 13:19:53+00:00	Grab-and-Go breakfast and lunch is available at the entrance of EVERY @NYCSchools building between 7:30 AM and 1:30 PM — ANY student can pick up a meal at ANY school building. Head to http://schools.nyc.gov for more information.
945	2020-03-18 03:15:13+00:00	After a tough few weeks, we had some really good news today: an agreement we locked with @NYCHealthSystem and BioReference Laboratories will allow us to test 5,000 people a day for COVID-19. We’re in a race against time and this will help us beat the clock and save lives.
946	2020-03-17 21:55:49+00:00	This is a challenging time for our city — but New Yorkers are tough and resilient. Look out for your neighbors. If they need food, supplies or help, offer it. Be there for them. We’ll get through this together.
947	2020-03-17 21:55:49+00:00	Things are changing every day. We want to keep you up to date. Text COVID to 692-692 to have important alerts sent to your phone.
948	2020-03-17 21:55:49+00:00	A decade ago, we bailed out the banks and the auto industry. We've funded endless wars and given tax cuts to the wealthy. The federal government knows how to spend quickly, on a huge scale. It's time to spend that money on the working people of our country.
949	2020-03-17 21:55:48+00:00	We NEED more support from the federal government. In terms of sheer reach and the response we need, the only parallels out there are the 1918 flu epidemic or the Great Depression. There are some encouraging developments, but nowhere near the level required.
950	2020-03-17 21:55:48+00:00	Today I spoke with the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley. The military has enormous capacity to mobilize people and resources in a crisis. We’re staying in close contact about any and all support the military can provide right now.
951	2020-03-17 21:55:48+00:00	We currently have 814 positive cases. We have lost 7 of our fellow New Yorkers. It's devastating. Our hearts go out to their families.
952	2020-03-17 21:55:47+00:00	I just signed an Executive Order to ban ride shares and pools to protect drivers and riders alike. This will give everyone more social distance. We’re doing this in agreement with the major ride share companies.
953	2020-03-17 21:55:47+00:00	Now for some other updates: Alternate Side Parking is SUSPENDED until next Tuesday, March 24, at which point we’ll reassess.
954	2020-03-17 21:55:46+00:00	For people who are otherwise healthy or have only moderate symptoms, please: STAY HOME. Don’t go to an ER unless you are seriously ill. If you feel sick with cold or flu symptoms, wait 3-4 days and if your symptoms don’t improve, call your doctor.
955	2020-03-17 21:55:46+00:00	This is incredibly important for our hospitals. Doctors need to be able to test whether a seriously ill patient has COVID-19 or something else like bacterial pneumonia. Those are potentially life or death stakes, and the right diagnosis matters.
956	2020-03-17 21:55:46+00:00	We have good news to report when we need it most: a new agreement locked last night will give @NYCHealthSystem capacity for 5,000 coronavirus tests per day. We’re in a race against time. This will help our public hospitals diagnose and treat people with serious illness faster.
957	2020-03-17 21:55:45+00:00	The message is simple: if you're a health care worker with appropriate training, your city needs you now. Go to http://nyc.gov/helpnownyc to join this fight.
958	2020-03-17 21:55:45+00:00	Today we’re making an urgent appeal: our health care system is bracing for what’s to come. We need every available medical professional who can serve. We’re activating the 9,000 licensed and retired workers in the Medical Reserve Corps to come forward.
959	2020-03-17 21:37:08+00:00	We wish them a speedy recovery. But, with all due respect, an entire NBA team should NOT get tested for COVID-19 while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick.
960	2020-03-17 21:20:42+00:00	ENOUGH. Anyone exploiting this crisis to spread hate and fear is attacking ALL New Yorkers. This is a hate crime and she was charged accordingly. Hate has no home in New York City. If you’re the victim of a hate crime, call 911 IMMEDIATELY.
961	2020-03-17 18:27:00+00:00	Join us at City Hall with an update on our city's response to COVID-19.
962	2020-03-17 13:20:29+00:00	The Irish immigrants who came to our shores were not strangers to struggles and uncertainty — but their indomitable spirit gave them the power to persevere. New York City’s streets may be empty this St. Patrick’s Day, but thanks to that very same spirit, our hearts are full.
963	2020-03-17 13:02:17+00:00	The COVID-19 crisis has created no end of challenges, but our students can still count on the team at @NYCSchools for their meals. Grab-and-Go breakfast and lunch is available at ANY school for ANY student from 7:30 AM to 1:30 PM. Head to http://schools.nyc.gov for more.
964	2020-03-17 00:57:40+00:00	If you’re looking for someone to pin this crisis on, try the guy who made up a phony Google website or promised testing kits that he STILL hasn’t delivered. Our Asian-American communities — people YOU serve — are already suffering. They don’t need you fueling more bigotry.
965	2020-03-16 22:56:07+00:00	The actions we take now will affect the way millions of people live. But they’ll save lives. Social distancing, monitoring your health, helping our most vulnerable neighbors: this is EVERY New Yorker's responsibility. It's time to step up. Like New Yorkers always do.
966	2020-03-16 22:56:07+00:00	As of this hour we have 463 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City. I'm sorry to say we have had 2 additional deaths since our last update, bringing the total in our city to 7. We grieve with their families and loved ones.
967	2020-03-16 22:56:07+00:00	We've instituted a ban on price gouging on supplies needed in this crisis, including thermometers, sanitizing and baby wipes, paper towels, latex gloves, face masks, toilet paper and rubbing alcohol. Retailers will be fined for increasing the cost of those items by 10% or more.
968	2020-03-16 22:56:07+00:00	We cannot thank our @NYCSchools staff enough. Educators, custodians, cafeteria workers and all school staff have stepped up to the challenge. Because of your good work, our children will get the food and education they deserve.
969	2020-03-16 22:56:07+00:00	@NYCSchools will begin remote learning for students on Monday, March 23. We'll also convert some school sites into enrichment centers for the children of essential employees like health care workers, transit workers and first responders.
970	2020-03-16 22:56:06+00:00	FEMA's efforts have been encouraging. But we STILL need help from the federal government. At the moment our supply chain is good but we need the federal government to ensure it stays that way. We need the Senate to pass a stimulus. People's lives and livelihoods are on the line.
971	2020-03-16 22:56:06+00:00	We are partnering with FEMA to create more drive-through testing facilities across the five boroughs. These locations will be for priority patients only.
972	2020-03-16 22:56:06+00:00	To EVERY health care worker in our city — active, retired, students — we need you right now. We need your experience and expertise to help protect the lives of our fellow New Yorkers.
973	2020-03-16 22:56:06+00:00	Public hospitals are canceling elective surgeries and discharging patients that no longer require in-patient care to free up 7,000 more beds. More will follow.
974	2020-03-16 22:56:05+00:00	We're radically expanding our health care capacity to meet the coming crisis. We're bringing four facilities online to boost capacity by 1,200 new beds.
975	2020-03-16 22:56:04+00:00	Today I signed an executive order that gives the City power to enforce new rules requiring all restaurants, bars and cafes to shift to delivery and take-out only at 8 PM tonight, and closing all movie theaters, small theaters, nightclubs and commercial gyms.
976	2020-03-16 19:45:07+00:00	Join us at City Hall for a briefing on our continued COVID-19 response in New York City.
977	2020-03-16 15:21:14+00:00	We’re in the middle of a national emergency as we confront a global pandemic, and the United States military is STILL engaged in building Trump’s useless border walls. Take them off that and put them on the coronavirus crisis for God's sake.
978	2020-03-16 03:19:51+00:00	The COVID-19 crisis is coming at us so fast. It can feel alarming and heartbreaking all at once. If you’re having trouble with it, you are not alone, New York. Call 1-888-NYC-Well or text WELL to 65173. This will get better. And your city is with you every step of the way.
979	2020-03-16 02:06:13+00:00	We will come through this, but until we do, we must make whatever sacrifices necessary to help our fellow New Yorkers.
980	2020-03-16 02:06:12+00:00	This is not a decision I make lightly. These places are part of the heart and soul of our city. They are part of what it means to be a New Yorker. But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality.
981	2020-03-16 02:06:12+00:00	Nightclubs, movie theaters, small theater houses, and concert venues must all close. The order will go into effect Tuesday, March 17 at 9:00 AM.
982	2020-03-16 02:06:12+00:00	The virus can spread rapidly through the close interactions New Yorkers have in restaurants, bars and places where we sit close together. We have to break that cycle. Tomorrow, I will sign an Executive Order limiting restaurants, bars and cafes to food take-out and delivery.
983	2020-03-16 02:06:12+00:00	Our lives are all changing in ways that were unimaginable just a week ago. We are taking a series of actions that we never would have taken otherwise in an effort to save the lives of loved ones and our neighbors. Now it is time to take yet another drastic step.
984	2020-03-15 23:24:57+00:00	This crisis will last months and it will get worse before it gets better. But it will get better. From September 11th to the financial crisis, the world has always looked to New York City to respond and to lead. And we always do. It's time to show that to the world again.
985	2020-03-15 23:24:57+00:00	Right now, we have 329 cases of COVID-19 in New York City. We have lost 5 New Yorkers. We know both of these numbers are going to grow substantially.
986	2020-03-15 23:24:57+00:00	Everyone knows someone at risk. We all know someone working on the front lines in hospitals and clinics. Everything we're doing as a city we do for them.
987	2020-03-15 23:24:56+00:00	We need to treat this like wartime— and we have a simple mission: protect the people most vulnerable and protect our health care system.
988	2020-03-15 23:24:56+00:00	As of today, we are also closing our senior centers and converting them into feeding centers where our seniors can pick up meals. We don’t do any of this lightly, but we do it to protect our most vulnerable.
989	2020-03-15 23:24:56+00:00	If you have a family member, a friend or a neighbor who is a health care worker, transit worker or first responder, step up and offer to help them with childcare.
990	2020-03-15 23:24:56+00:00	We’ll begin providing supervision for those workers’ children starting Monday March 23. But for this coming week, we need your help New York.
991	2020-03-15 23:24:56+00:00	The workers on the frontlines of this crisis are counting on all of us. We need health care workers, transit workers and first responders at their posts, and so we need to look after their children.
992	2020-03-15 23:24:55+00:00	We know hundreds of thousands of kids depend on our schools for their meals. We’ll have grab and go breakfast and lunch available at all school buildings starting tomorrow.
993	2020-03-15 23:24:55+00:00	Today, we made the painful decision to suspend classes in all NYC public schools, beginning tomorrow March 16. We’re going to begin remote digital learning on Monday March 23, and we’ll do everything in our power to help our kids through this.
994	2020-03-15 21:30:43+00:00	Join me at City Hall for an important update on our city's response to COVID-19.
995	2020-03-15 02:53:40+00:00	To Assembly Members Charles Barron and Helene Weinstein who tested positive for COVID-19: your city has your back. @NYCFirstLady and I are keeping you in our thoughts tonight. This crisis will impact all of us — but we’re all in this together and we will get through it together.
996	2020-03-14 22:32:57+00:00	We don't tolerate hatred and discrimination against Asian New Yorkers. We didn't before the COVID-19 crisis, we don't today and we NEVER will. Call 311 to report any acts of discrimination. Call 911 to report a hate crime.
997	2020-03-14 20:39:02+00:00	Knowledge is power. Get the facts. Text 'COVID' to 692-692 to receive important updates from @NotifyNYC sent straight to your phone. More information available here: http://nyc.gov/coronavirus
998	2020-03-14 20:39:00+00:00	We need everyone to take precautions to limit the impact of this crisis. STAY HOME if sick, even if you think it's just a cold. Telecommute if possible or commute to work during off hours. These are trying times and we need to change our behaviors to navigate our new reality.
999	2020-03-14 20:38:58+00:00	We have a student at IS 27 Staten Island who tested positive for COVID-19. This student was NOT in school last week, while symptomatic. Cleaning will happen now, contact tracing will happen immediately and the school will reopen Monday.
1000	2020-03-14 20:38:58+00:00	31 members of the fire house will be quarantined immediately. The house will be cleaned and fully operational by 6pm.
1001	2020-03-14 20:38:58+00:00	A few updates about some specific cases: A FDNY member tested positive for COVID-19. He worked Sunday-Tuesday, testing positive late yesterday. He did NOT respond to any medical runs or treat patients.
1002	2020-03-14 20:38:58+00:00	@SenSchumer is absolutely right: @senatemajldr go to work and DO YOUR JOB.
1003	2020-03-14 20:38:57+00:00	How ON EARTH did @senatemajldr McConnell let the US Senate go out of session during a national crisis and a global pandemic? The bill that @SpeakerPelosi and the House passed last night can provide access to care and relief for families.
1004	2020-03-14 20:38:57+00:00	I was joined today by @SenSchumer who has really come through for New York City in this crisis. Thanks to him, @SpeakerPelosi and NYC’s congressional delegation, we’re finally seeing the action we need from the federal government.
1005	2020-03-14 20:38:55+00:00	It's a moral imperative for New Yorkers to think about those most at risk and take action. If you're sick or anyone around you is sick, now's NOT the time to visit elderly family and friends or those with pre-existing conditions. If you're sick, STAY HOME. We can’t say it enough.
1006	2020-03-14 20:38:55+00:00	A majority of the people hospitalized because of COVID-19 in NYC are over 50 and/or have pre-existing medical conditions. NOW is the time to take serious precautions to keep the most vulnerable safe.
1007	2020-03-14 20:38:54+00:00	This is a painful moment for our city, as we grieve the first victim of coronavirus. It's a moment we knew would come but it doesn't make it easier. An 82-year-old woman, who had previously been diagnosed with emphysema, passed away this morning. Our hearts are with her family.
1008	2020-03-14 19:22:34+00:00	Our country is in a war-time scenario but we're getting a Mar-a-Lago attitude from the federal government. We need testing, ventilators, surgical masks and we needed them WEEKS AGO, when @realDonaldTrump was still calling this pandemic a hoax.
1009	2020-03-14 17:22:06+00:00	Join me and @SenSchumer at City Hall for updates on our response to COVID-19.
1010	2020-03-14 15:23:40+00:00	We all have a part to play here. I ask every New Yorker to do their part and take the necessary precautionary measures to protect the people most at risk.
1011	2020-03-14 15:23:40+00:00	I want to thank the staff of Wyckoff Medical Center for their efforts to save this woman’s life, and all the medical professionals on the front lines protecting our most vulnerable.
1012	2020-03-14 15:23:40+00:00	We’ve known from the outset that these people are the most at risk in this pandemic, and today’s news is a sad confirmation of that reality.
1013	2020-03-14 15:23:35+00:00	Today, we are confirming our first death due to severe complications from COVID-19. The patient, an elderly woman with advanced emphysema, was admitted to the hospital last week as one of our first cases, and had been in critical condition ever since.
1014	2020-03-14 13:38:10+00:00	There are a lot of rumors and misinformation at a time like this. We will continue to provide New Yorkers with the most up to date information available. Text COVID to 692692, go to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus or call 311 to get constant updates and stay in the know.
1015	2020-03-14 13:38:08+00:00	You have the largest, strongest City government in the country, and we’ve been preparing for this since the first alerts about coronavirus in January.
1016	2020-03-14 01:45:35+00:00	To every single member of the NYPD: if you’re ever struggling and need someone to talk to, reach out. Free, confidential help is standing by.
1017	2020-03-14 01:45:32+00:00	New York City is in mourning. We’ve lost one of our Finest in one of the most painful ways imaginable. Please keep their family, loved ones and fellow officers in your hearts tonight.
1018	2020-03-14 00:37:47+00:00	Please continue to monitor http://nyc.gov/coronavirus and text COVID to 692-692 for more updates. I can't thank New Yorkers enough. This is an extraordinarily difficult time and you've risen to the challenge.
1019	2020-03-14 00:37:46+00:00	If you're feeling anxious or upset by everything happening right now, you’re not alone. If you need someone to talk to, call 1-888-NYC-Well. Trained counselors are there for you.
1020	2020-03-14 00:37:46+00:00	There was some misinformation spread earlier today that suggested the NYPD was being denied masks. This is NOT TRUE. I spoke with @NYPDShea today and we are delivering 250,000 more masks. Anything the NYPD needs they will GET.
1021	2020-03-14 00:37:46+00:00	We have a request in to the FDA for 2.2 million more N95 masks from the strategic stockpile. We can report right now that @NYCHealthy has 16 million surgical masks in their emergency stockpile and should be getting 25 million more in the next two weeks.
1022	2020-03-14 00:37:46+00:00	We saw some fresh help from the federal government. The President's emergency declaration is promising. The @US_FDA has approved one company to create faster, automated testing. Automation could allow us to test in the thousands. We need more companies to be approved.
1023	2020-03-14 00:37:46+00:00	We MUST protect our schools, our transit system and especially our health care system and our health care workers. We have the biggest and best health care system in America — and we’re making sure it’s ready for what’s ahead.
1024	2020-03-14 00:37:45+00:00	Those kids and their families are counting on our public schools to be there. Parents who work as first responders and health care workers depend on our schools so they can be out on the front lines of this crisis.
1025	2020-03-14 00:37:45+00:00	Even with all the shock of the last two days, well over 600,000 students came to school today. We are taking new steps to make sure students and staff are safe by increasing social distancing.
1026	2020-03-14 00:37:45+00:00	I spent 17 years as a New York City public school parent. I understand the anxiety. But I also know how many parents are depending on us keeping our schools open.
1027	2020-03-14 00:37:45+00:00	I know there's tremendous concern among parents, students, staff and caregivers about our public schools and whether they remain open.
1028	2020-03-14 00:37:45+00:00	Here are the latest updates on COVID-19 in New York City: As of today we have 154 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. We have 29 people in mandatory quarantine and 1,747 in voluntary isolation.
1029	2020-03-14 00:37:44+00:00	We know the COVID-19 crisis feels like it changes by the hour. It’s been a sobering week, but we saw signs today that every level of government is putting more into this fight.
1030	2020-03-13 21:33:24+00:00	Yesterday, I declared a State of Emergency in New York City. I want to lay out exactly what that means:
1031	2020-03-13 21:22:26+00:00	Join us at City Hall for the latest on our response to COVID-19.
1032	2020-03-13 17:03:31+00:00	If you are the victim of a hate crime or witness what you believe to be a hate crime, call 911 immediately. NYPD officers will not ask about the immigration status of anyone seeking help.
1033	2020-03-13 17:02:58+00:00	Discrimination and hate crimes are ILLEGAL in New York City. They were illegal before the COVID-19 crisis and they ALWAYS will be. Call 311 and say “human rights” to report harassment or discrimination in housing, at work, or in public places.
1034	2020-03-13 13:59:39+00:00	We have GOOD NEWS to report: the @US_FDA has given an approval for faster, automated coronavirus testing. We’ve been pushing hard for this and we’re working to get it up and running on the ground here in NYC as fast as possible.
1035	2020-03-13 05:51:57+00:00	I know families are anxious right now — to our parents, know that your city is being extra vigilant to protect our schools. We will keep everyone in our schools community up to date with information as we have it.
1036	2020-03-13 05:51:57+00:00	We will also be closing the Brooklyn College Academy after a college student reported as positive, and four Brooklyn Occupational Centers due to a teacher who has self-reported as positive. We will work to have these schools reopened as soon as possible.
1037	2020-03-13 05:51:54+00:00	We can confirm an @NYCSchools student on Staten Island has tested positive for COVID-19 and out of an abundance of caution we will be closing the the New Dorp HS + Hungerford building for cleaning on Friday.
1038	2020-03-13 03:01:08+00:00	You have the largest, strongest City government in the country, and it’s been preparing for this for weeks. The basic services you rely on every single day aren’t going anywhere. The sun will rise tomorrow and your city will rise to meet it.
1039	2020-03-13 02:59:42+00:00	A lot of understandably anxious people stocked up their fridges and cabinets today. Rest assured, there’s no need for that. Our supply chain is active and deliveries are rolling in as normal. Shelves will restock. Remember: facts, not fear.
1040	2020-03-13 02:58:18+00:00	I know news related to the COVID-19 crisis is coming at a breakneck pace. It can feel alarming. Let’s take a deep breath, New York.
1041	2020-03-13 01:06:51+00:00	This is our new reality and it won't be over soon. But I know New Yorkers. I know we will fight back, support each other and get through this together. We will prevail. Continue to monitor http://nyc.gov/coronavirus and text COVID to 692-692 for real time updates from @NotifyNYC.
1042	2020-03-13 01:06:50+00:00	There are non-essential school activities we will either cancel or find new solutions for. PSAL games and practices, school assemblies, plays and recitals will be cancelled. Parent-teacher conferences and PTA meetings will be done by phone or web based when possible.
1043	2020-03-13 01:06:50+00:00	We’ll make any individual school closure decisions on a case by case basis. We’ll give as much notice to parents and staff as we can, and work to reopen as soon as possible. Keeping people safe and informed will be our top priority.
1044	2020-03-13 01:06:50+00:00	NYC public schools are essential. And they are remaining open, even as we cut back non essential activity in school buildings. So many kids rely on them for meals. Parents need them so they can go to work. And every student relies on them to learn.
1045	2020-03-13 01:06:49+00:00	We are dealing with something we've never seen in our lives. We are calling on the federal government to provide additional relief for our residents, whose lives have and will be upended. Americans could be facing a half a year without work. We need to see action now.
1046	2020-03-13 01:06:49+00:00	The human impact will be extensive. We will provide free legal help to anyone facing evictions and provide short term support. If necessary we will also be activating emergency food contracts and community organizations will increase food aid for lower-income New Yorkers.
1047	2020-03-13 01:06:49+00:00	None of us wanted to take these actions. This crisis could easily be a six month crisis and the recovery from it could take a long time. We didn't do this lightly, but it was necessary.
1048	2020-03-13 01:06:49+00:00	There will be restrictions on establishments and venues with capacity under 500 persons that require them to cut occupancy in half to increase social distancing.
1049	2020-03-13 01:06:48+00:00	We're in agreement with the state to enforce a rule barring large gatherings of 500 or more people. This will affect parades, rallies, sporting events, conferences and performance venues. For most venues this will begin 5 PM on Friday. For Broadway theaters it began tonight.
1050	2020-03-13 01:06:48+00:00	We have 95 confirmed cases of COVID-19. We know that’s going to grow quickly. We are taking new precautions that every New Yorker will feel in their daily lives.
1051	2020-03-13 01:06:47+00:00	To help halt the community spread of COVID-19, I’ve declared a state of emergency in New York City. There are a lot of rumors at a time like this, so here are the simple facts:
1052	2020-03-13 00:04:22+00:00	Just spoke with @SecAzar about NYC’s immediate need for more testing. Discussed the specific needs of our Public Health Lab + my request that private labs be approved for automated testing. He was responsive + promised quick answers. Hoping + praying that help is finally coming
1053	2020-03-12 22:20:31+00:00	NO, there is NO TRUTH to rumors about Manhattan being quarantined. Whoever is spreading this misinformation, PLEASE STOP NOW!
1054	2020-03-12 20:05:34+00:00	Join us at City Hall for updates and announcements on our city’s COVID-19 response.
1055	2020-03-12 12:27:50+00:00	We don’t make this decision lightly, and we know the disruption and anxiety this means for students, faculty and parents. We are taking every precaution to keep people safe, and we will keep everyone informed as we learn more through the day.
1056	2020-03-12 12:27:49+00:00	The Health Department will trace close contacts of this individual to recommend quarantine and testing as necessary. The Department of Education will completely disinfect the building, and it will be closed for an initial 24-hour period.
1057	2020-03-12 12:27:49+00:00	This morning, we are closing two co-located schools, the Laboratory School of Finance and Technology and South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, due to a student’s self-confirmed positive case of COVID-19.
1058	2020-03-12 03:52:09+00:00	Whether it’s in the heat of summer or on a clear fall day, New Yorkers will come together to celebrate St. Patrick’s day and our city’s great Irish-American community.
1059	2020-03-12 03:52:08+00:00	I know this decision didn’t come easy, so I’ll make this promise: this is a postponement, not a cancellation.
1060	2020-03-12 02:31:12+00:00	New Yorkers don’t care where virus came from. They just want every level of Government to do the utmost to halt the spread.
1061	2020-03-12 02:26:19+00:00	After weeks of minimizing what has now become a global pandemic, we were hoping for concerted action. Instead, the President remains all but silent on the most important thing: rapid, expansive testing.
1062	2020-03-11 23:14:19+00:00	You can get COVID-19 updates sent straight to your phone by texting ‘COVID’ to 692692 or you can go to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more information.
1063	2020-03-11 23:14:19+00:00	We will NOT tolerate any discrimination or hatred in New York City. Now is not the time to be divided, it's time to look out for one another. If you are the victim of a hate crime or if you witness any form of discrimination call 311.
1064	2020-03-11 23:14:18+00:00	While this may sound daunting, we have the BEST health care system in the nation. Our hospitals will NOT ask documentation status and we will NEVER withhold care from those who can’t afford it.
1065	2020-03-11 23:14:18+00:00	This could be our new reality for months and it's on all of us to contribute to ending this crisis. We can change the trajectory of COVID-19, starting with common sense hygiene for ourselves and helping to protect seniors and people with chronic health conditions from exposure.
1066	2020-03-11 23:14:18+00:00	There are currently 53 cases of COVID-19 in New York City. If you feel sick, don't go to work. Call your doctor. If symptoms persist, get to health care or call 311.
1067	2020-03-11 20:51:07+00:00	There are a lot of moving parts to this crisis. We’ll update the record anytime something changes. And if we don’t get something right, we’ll be quick to say so. We need to be both fast and accurate to slow the spread of COVID-19.
1068	2020-03-11 20:51:02+00:00	Earlier today I misspoke with a 311 caller about one of our coronavirus recommendations. We called them back with the correct info but I want every New Yorker to be aware: We DO urge people with recent travel to Italy to self-quarantine for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms.
1069	2020-03-11 19:43:06+00:00	I’m at City Hall to brief community and ethnic media on New York City’s response to COVID-19. Tune in now.
1070	2020-03-11 16:38:38+00:00	This sentence ONLY happened because of the brave women who spoke out. When we believe survivors, dangerous people end up where they belong.
1071	2020-03-11 00:35:16+00:00	Discrimination is ILLEGAL in New York City. If you experience or see any sort of hate crime or discrimination related to COVID-19 or anything, please report it immediately. To New York City's vibrant Asian-American community: your city stands with you.
1072	2020-03-10 22:03:17+00:00	New Yorkers are resilient people and I remain so proud of them for taking this crisis seriously. Things are moving quickly but this city is meeting the moment. Please continue to monitor http://nyc.gov/coronavirus and text COVID to 692-692 for real time updates from @NotifyNYC.
1073	2020-03-10 22:03:16+00:00	Our blood supply is currently very good but we're hearing reports of blood drives cancelled over COVID-19. I want to be clear here: there is NO health risk in giving blood during this crisis. Follow @NYBloodCenter or @RedCrossNY to find a blood drive near you.
1074	2020-03-10 22:03:16+00:00	Outreach teams are continuing to check in with our city's homeless population. So far there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 but our teams are in continual contact with homeless New Yorkers and are prepared to help them come in if they experience any symptoms.
1075	2020-03-10 22:03:16+00:00	Anyone returning from a cruise with a fever will be sent home and asked to contact their doctor immediately or sent to the hospital.
1076	2020-03-10 22:03:16+00:00	To be blunt: it's NOT the time to take a cruise. Anyone leaving our city by ship will be screened before boarding. Anyone with a temperature over 100.4 will not be allowed to board.
1077	2020-03-10 22:03:15+00:00	As we enter the community spread stage of COVID-19, we're asking New Yorkers to make more adjustments to daily life. Keep using the common sense tactics — wash your hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching your face, monitor your health and if you feel sick STAY HOME.
1078	2020-03-10 22:03:15+00:00	Here are the latest updates on COVID-19 in New York City: We can confirm there are 16 new COVID-19 cases as of March 10th, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New York City to 36.
1079	2020-03-10 18:31:24+00:00	I'm at @BellevueHosp in Manhattan with important updates on our city's response to COVID-19.
1080	2020-03-10 00:41:27+00:00	Chag Purim Sameach! To all of our Jewish neighbors celebrating Purim tonight, @NYCFirstLady and I wish you a joyous holiday.
1081	2020-03-09 22:34:54+00:00	We've said this before and we'll say it again: this crisis could be with us for months. It will take everyone to help slow the spread. We cannot say it enough: Wash your hands and if you or your child is sick, STAY HOME.
1082	2020-03-09 22:34:54+00:00	To the federal government: we need you to do the simplest thing in the world and have the FDA approve automated COVID-19 tests. We're bringing back hundreds of results. We could be bringing thousands. The FDA could do it with the stoke of a pen TODAY.
1083	2020-03-09 22:34:54+00:00	To retailers: price gouging in the middle of this crisis is immoral, unfair, and it will COST YOU. If you gouge prices on masks, hand sanitizer and disinfected wipes you will be FINED. If you see any price gouging report it to 311.
1084	2020-03-09 22:34:53+00:00	We have had 8 new cases since yesterday bringing NYC's total to 20 confirmed. Disease detectives are doing their work to identify close contacts and we’ll continue to provide updates as we have them.
1085	2020-03-09 22:34:53+00:00	Stay informed. We’re getting new information daily and we want New Yorkers to stay in the know about COVID-19. Text COVID to 692-692 for regular updates or go to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more.
1086	2020-03-09 22:34:53+00:00	I am so proud of New Yorkers. We're tough people and we're making the necessary changes and listening to guidance to help stop the spread of this crisis. It's a job of the government to lead but the people will be the solution to this crisis.
1087	2020-03-09 22:34:53+00:00	We know there's a lot of anxiety out there in response to COVID-19. People are looking to their government for information and we have not gotten the answers we need from the federal government. I want you to know this City is working tirelessly to keep people safe.
1088	2020-03-09 17:56:07+00:00	Join us at @NYCEmergencyMgt headquarters in Brooklyn with an update on our city’s response to COVID-19.
1089	2020-03-09 00:47:03+00:00	Tonight I’m not just thinking of the great contributions women have made to our city and country — I’m thinking of the movements women are leading right now. Let us recommit ourselves to standing with them in the fight for true equality. #InternationalWomensDay
1090	2020-03-08 21:04:47+00:00	We’re learning more about this virus every day and will continue to update you with information. You can text COVID to 692-692 for real-time updates.
1091	2020-03-08 21:04:47+00:00	Plan to have some extra travel time in your commute. If the train that pulls up is too packed, move to a different car or wait to take the next one. Bike or walk to work if you can.
1092	2020-03-08 21:04:47+00:00	Stagger work schedules so people can arrive later or leave earlier to beat the busiest times of rush hour.
1093	2020-03-08 21:04:46+00:00	Finally, we need everyone to do their part in reducing overcrowding. I know that sounds impossible in New York City, but consider some basic steps like telecommuting if your job allows it.
1094	2020-03-08 21:04:46+00:00	If you have family or loved ones with these kinds of chronic conditions and you yourself feel sick, do NOT visit them. I know that’s hard to hear but you will be putting them at a greater risk. Stay home.
1095	2020-03-08 21:04:46+00:00	This part is VERY important: we need to protect people who are the most likely to get seriously ill if they contract COVID-19. If you have chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or a weakened immune system, avoid unnecessary events and gatherings.
1096	2020-03-08 21:04:46+00:00	Call 311 if you need help getting connected to care — and remember, your city will provide care regardless of your immigration status or ability to pay. Our public hospitals and clinics WILL take care of you.
1097	2020-03-08 21:04:45+00:00	We need everyone to monitor their health more than usual. If you feel flu or cold-like symptoms — coughing, fever, shortness of breath — STAY HOME and call your doctor. If you don’t feel better within 24-48 hours, get to your doctor.
1098	2020-03-08 21:04:45+00:00	It can’t be said enough: DO NOT touch your face with unwashed hands and for the foreseeable future don’t shake hands — I know that sounds unusual but it’s an easy way to reduce risk.
1099	2020-03-08 21:04:45+00:00	First, protect yourself and your neighbors with common sense practices like washing your hands with soap and water often and covering your nose and mouth with a sleeve or tissue whenever you sneeze or cough.
1100	2020-03-08 21:04:45+00:00	With the number of COVID-19 cases growing, we know there’s a lot of anxiety and confusion out there. Here are some things that EVERY New Yorker can do to help reduce the spread of COVID-19:
1101	2020-03-08 18:32:11+00:00	Join us at @NYCEmergencyMgt Headquarters for updates on our city’s response to COVID-19.
1102	2020-03-07 23:43:37+00:00	A warning for New York City businesses — we have ZERO tolerance for anyone taking advantage of an epidemic to gouge prices. Violations have already been issued to businesses and there will be consequences if this continues.
1103	2020-03-07 22:37:25+00:00	We’re especially focused on people over 50 and those with chronic underlying health conditions. Help us keep them and everyone else safe. Practice good hygiene like washing your hands with soap and water, and if you feel unwell, stay home and call your doctor.
1104	2020-03-07 22:37:25+00:00	Additionally, a Manhattan man in his late 50s tested positive after spending time with a COVID-19 positive person on a recent trip to Chile. He is symptomatic and under mandatory quarantine.
1105	2020-03-07 22:37:25+00:00	A male in his 30s from Brooklyn is currently in the hospital in serious condition after returning from a trip to Italy.
1106	2020-03-07 22:37:25+00:00	Two women in Brooklyn in their 60s and 70s became symptomatic after returning from a cruise from Egypt with a known confirmed case of COVID-19. They are both at home in mandatory quarantine.
1107	2020-03-07 22:37:25+00:00	Common sense precaution: Stay home if you feel sick -- that includes drivers. That’s the same guidance we’re giving everyone right now.
1108	2020-03-07 22:37:24+00:00	A male Uber driver in his 30s is currently hospitalized in Queens. He is not a TLC licensed driver, and primarily drives on Long Island.
1109	2020-03-07 22:37:24+00:00	Two additional family members of an Upper West Side man in his 50s tested positive — his wife and 11-year-old daughter. They are currently in mandatory quarantine and are mildly symptomatic.
1110	2020-03-07 22:37:24+00:00	We’ll be holding a press conference tomorrow afternoon with more updates, but I want to provide information on the 7 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City. What we know:
1111	2020-03-07 18:46:20+00:00	The FDA will be holding a briefing from the White House any minute. New Yorkers need answers and we need them NOW.
1112	2020-03-07 17:30:52+00:00	We NEED FDA approval of automated testing for COVID-19 to keep up with growing cases and get results in time to stop the spread. We keep asking. No answer. Media: On behalf of 8.6 million New Yorkers, demand answers from the @US_FDA and @RealDonaldTrump. @CNN @NBCNews @CBSNews
1113	2020-03-07 03:54:15+00:00	It’s been non-stop this week, but Chirlane, Dante and I got a few minutes to make some new friends at Gracie tonight. It was a thrill to pay tribute to one of the Bronx’s greatest heroes — and her fiancé.
1114	2020-03-07 02:35:29+00:00	I know people are anxious and we will continue to update with more information as we have it. New Yorkers are resilient — I know we will get through this together. Head to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more info.
1115	2020-03-07 02:35:29+00:00	This is a city that guarantees health care for everyone who needs it, regardless of ability to pay or immigration status. If you do not have insurance or don't know where to go, call 311. We will help you find a facility. If you're unable to pay, you will still get treated.
1116	2020-03-07 02:35:29+00:00	We need the FDA to approve faster, more efficient testing. The faster the results, the faster we can limit the spread.
1117	2020-03-07 02:35:29+00:00	Now for some good news: we've had a major breakthrough bringing private sector testing online. This means we can test hundreds of people per day — but we want to get to testing thousands of people per day.
1118	2020-03-07 02:35:29+00:00	Let your doctor know about your symptoms. If they don’t get better in 24-48 hours, get to your doctor. If you don't have a doctor or don't know where to get care and testing, call 311.
1119	2020-03-07 02:35:28+00:00	Even though the common cold and flu are much more common causes of symptoms than COVID-19, we want those who might have COVID-19 to get care and not spread it to others. So STAY HOME if you have cold or flu symptoms. Same applies for school-aged kids.
1120	2020-03-07 02:35:28+00:00	New Yorkers are used to powering through the workweek when they’re feeling sick, but we’re asking you to change that.
1121	2020-03-07 02:35:28+00:00	Monitor your own health more closely than usual. Watch for symptoms of cold and flu: sore throat, cough, fever, shortness of breath. Treat it differently than usual. This is important.
1122	2020-03-07 02:35:28+00:00	First: for New Yorkers who are well and have NO symptoms, take basic precautions: wash your hands thoroughly, don’t touch your face and avoid handshakes and other hand-to-hand contact.
1123	2020-03-07 02:35:27+00:00	We’re giving new guidance to New Yorkers to keep our city safe.
1124	2020-03-07 02:35:27+00:00	So far we've had 5 people test positive for COVID-19. 47 people have tested negative. 40 have results pending.
1125	2020-03-07 02:35:27+00:00	We’re seeing more examples of community transmission of COVID-19 in New York City between people who have no direct connection to travel to one of the affected countries.
1126	2020-03-06 23:10:21+00:00	I’m at @NYCEmergencyMgt headquarters in Brooklyn with the latest on our city’s response to COVID-19
1127	2020-03-06 02:50:48+00:00	We can’t say it enough. WASH YOUR HANDS. OFTEN. Avoid touching your face. Cover your mouth with your arm when you cough or sneeze. The basics go a long way toward protecting you and others close to you. Head to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more information.
1128	2020-03-06 02:50:42+00:00	Get your flu shot. It’s not too late! It’s doesn’t protect you from COVID-19, but you DON’T want to get the flu right now and have to worry it might be COVID-19.
1129	2020-03-06 02:50:42+00:00	Refill your prescriptions! That ensures you’re stocked up in case you catch the virus or have to be isolated at home. We’re all watching supply chains of key things like medication in the event we see this disease become much more widespread. Best to be prepared.
1130	2020-03-06 02:50:42+00:00	I know a lot of people are reading today’s news about the coronavirus in NYC and are wondering what more they can do to protect themselves right now. Here are a few simple things:
1131	2020-03-06 02:01:34+00:00	Now that we're seeing community spread of the virus, each day could bring us new cases. This crisis could be with us for months. This won’t be the last order we issue. Please take precautions — head to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more information.
1132	2020-03-06 02:00:55+00:00	To any New Yorkers who have recently traveled to the five affected countries, we ask upon your return that you isolate yourselves for 14 days as a precaution. If you develop symptoms, please get to a doctor to get tested for COVID-19. If you need assistance call 311.
1133	2020-03-06 01:59:14+00:00	If you have any of those jobs with our City and have: ⚉ Recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea ⚉ Or have developed symptoms of COVID-19 ⚉ Or have come into close contact with someone testing positive You must get tested for COVID-19 immediately.
1134	2020-03-06 01:49:14+00:00	In response to COVID-19, @NYCHealthCommr Barbot is issuing directives to every educator, first responder and health care worker employed by the City of New York:
1135	2020-03-05 23:54:01+00:00	One of the greatest challenges in fighting COVID-19 is the lack of fast federal action to increase testing capacity. We need the CDC to send more kits. We need the FDA to fast track approval for testing methods developed by private institutions. And we need it NOW.
1136	2020-03-05 20:52:51+00:00	Neighborhood policing has brought police and communities together to drive crime down to record lows. It's saving lives and changing our city block by block. But obviously there's work that still needs to be done.
1137	2020-03-05 20:52:49+00:00	This was painful to watch. We still need to get all the facts about this case and a full investigation is underway, but I don’t like what I saw. It doesn't reflect what we’re building in New York City.
1138	2020-03-05 19:14:51+00:00	Join us at 1 Police Plaza for an update on our city's response to COVID-19.
1139	2020-03-05 13:36:36+00:00	Our single greatest challenge is the lack of fast federal action to increase testing capacity — without that, we cannot beat this epidemic back.
1140	2020-03-05 13:36:36+00:00	To ensure we are able to test as many people as possible, we urgently need the CDC to increase our supply of COVID-19 test kits and expedite the approval of any testing approaches developed by private companies.
1141	2020-03-05 13:36:36+00:00	We are taking the same decisive steps in every case to shut transmission down: isolate and test each suspected case, trace close contacts, and isolate and test them as well.
1142	2020-03-05 13:36:35+00:00	We are going to see more cases like this as community transmission becomes more common. We want New Yorkers to be prepared and vigilant, not alarmed.
1143	2020-03-05 13:36:35+00:00	Both are currently hospitalized and in the intensive care unit. City disease detectives are tracing close contacts of both individuals and will ensure they are appropriately isolated and tested immediately.
1144	2020-03-05 13:36:30+00:00	There are two new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City. One new patient is a man in his 40s, and one new patient is a woman in her 80s. Neither patient has a connection to travel nor any of the other local individuals diagnosed with COVID-19.
1145	2020-03-05 00:30:19+00:00	The coronavirus hasn't stopped your city from getting things done for working people. We just announced plans for the biggest swath of affordable housing since Co-op City: 12,000 homes at Sunnyside Yard — every single one of them affordable. #YOURhomeNYC
1146	2020-03-04 22:32:52+00:00	Abortions are ALREADY safe. And LEGAL. Let’s keep it that way and stop attempting to take a basic human right away from everyone who needs or wants it.
1147	2020-03-04 21:29:48+00:00	If you don’t have a doctor, call 311 and we will help you get care. Head to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more information.
1148	2020-03-04 21:29:48+00:00	This crisis could be with us for a long time. For most people, COVID-19 has the same symptoms as the flu or common cold — if you feel ANY symptoms of COVID-19 and have any nexus to the affected countries, contact your doctor right away.
1149	2020-03-04 21:29:48+00:00	All 200,000 TLC drivers have been instructed on wiping down surfaces in their vehicles daily with disinfectant to keep passengers and themselves healthy. We have also reiterated to EVERY driver that discrimination against passengers will not be tolerated.
1150	2020-03-04 21:29:47+00:00	Attendance rates right now are exactly the same as last year. Thank you to parents and students for going about your lives as normal!
1151	2020-03-04 21:29:47+00:00	Important for public school parents: we’re freezing attendance as an admissions criteria for the time being. Attendance during this period will NOT have an effect on next year’s offers.
1152	2020-03-04 21:29:47+00:00	We've issued cleaning guidance and distributed CDC-approved cleaning supplies to @NYCSchools. We’re ensuring kids have time during the day to wash hands regularly, and have provided guidance to school personnel on how to deal with students and staff who exhibit symptoms.
1153	2020-03-04 21:29:47+00:00	A son in the same family also tested positive for COVID-19. He is a student at Yeshiva University. Our disease detectives have so far identified people with whom he had close contact: a roommate and a close friend. Both are being tested today.
1154	2020-03-04 21:29:46+00:00	Our disease detectives identified 7 coworkers and one intern at a law firm who had close contact with the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Westchester. They’re undergoing testing themselves.
1155	2020-03-04 19:00:36+00:00	Join us at City Hall for an update on the most recent COVID-19 cases connected to New York City.
1156	2020-03-04 15:37:30+00:00	We will continue working closely with our State partners to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep New Yorkers safe.
1157	2020-03-04 15:37:30+00:00	City disease detectives are on campus to identify close contacts of the student and connect those individuals to testing immediately. As of this morning, two contacts have transferred to Bellevue hospital for testing.
1158	2020-03-04 15:37:30+00:00	Yeshiva University is working closely with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to take every necessary precaution to ensure the safety of students and the community.
1159	2020-03-04 15:37:29+00:00	A female child attends SAR Academy and High School in the Bronx. A male child attends Yeshiva University in Manhattan and has not been on campus since February 27. Both children and their mother, who also tested positive, remain in home isolation in Westchester.
1160	2020-03-04 15:37:29+00:00	Three family members of the Westchester resident who was diagnosed yesterday with the Coronavirus have tested positive for the Coronavirus.
1161	2020-03-04 14:09:54+00:00	Street closures are still in effect on North 7th Street from Bedford Avenue to Roebling Street and on Driggs Avenue from North 8th to North 6th Street. Please avoid the area and plan any travel accordingly while teams complete their work. Follow @NotifyNYC for further updates.
1162	2020-03-04 14:09:53+00:00	Following a water main break earlier this morning in Williamsburg, @FDNY, @NYCWater and @nycemergencymgt personnel are on the ground and have isolated the flow. They’re working quickly to restore service to affected buildings in the area.
1163	2020-03-03 22:27:38+00:00	The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene personnel are on the ground at the law firm, SAR Academy and Yeshiva University. Disease detectives are following up with anyone who had close contact with the patient or his kids to get them tested for coronavirus.
1164	2020-03-03 22:27:37+00:00	The patient has two children with a connection to New York City, a daughter who attends SAR Academy and High School in the Bronx, and a son who attends Yeshiva University in Manhattan. They’re currently in isolation at home.
1165	2020-03-03 22:27:37+00:00	We can officially confirm some more information on the second coronavirus case connected to New York City. The individual sought care on February 27 at Lawrence Hospital in Westchester. He works at Lewis and Garbuz, P.C., a law firm in Manhattan.
1166	2020-03-03 20:20:19+00:00	It can't be said enough: if you feel like you have the symptoms, contact your doctor right away. Don't take chances. If you have any issues getting in contact with a doctor, call 311 and we will help connect you with care. Head to http://nyc.gov/coronavirus for more information.
1167	2020-03-03 20:20:19+00:00	Cost will NOT be a barrier to coronavirus testing and treatment in New York City. If you have symptoms, call 311 or contact any NYC public hospital. We will get you the care you need, regardless of immigration status or ability to pay.
1168	2020-03-03 20:20:19+00:00	Remember, it takes close contact to contract the coronavirus, not casual contact like being on the same bus or sitting in the same classroom. The bigger risk factors are for people who share a home or work very closely together for an extended period of time.
1169	2020-03-03 20:20:18+00:00	The patient’s family members are being tested and we can confirm one of them currently has symptoms. They are isolated at home. Disease detectives are tracking down each and every close contact from both workplace and schools so we can test them as well.
1170	2020-03-03 20:20:18+00:00	Earlier today we announced a second confirmed case of coronavirus connected to our city — here are some updates: The individual is a Westchester County resident and he is currently hospitalized at Columbia Presbyterian in serious condition.
1171	2020-03-03 18:11:17+00:00	I’m at City Hall with an update on our city’s response to the coronavirus.
1172	2020-03-03 14:14:30+00:00	We have said from the beginning that is likely we will see more positive cases of the coronavirus. We are working closely with our state and federal partners to ensure we are taking the highest precautions necessary to keep New Yorkers safe.
1173	2020-03-03 14:14:29+00:00	With the results confirmed within a number of hours, we were immediately able to take next steps to stop the spread of this virus.
1174	2020-03-03 14:14:29+00:00	City and State disease detectives are working closely to identify close contacts and the appropriate next steps. The test was conducted by the New York City Public Health Laboratory on our first day of testing.
1175	2020-03-03 14:14:28+00:00	Yesterday, a New York State resident with respiratory issues was diagnosed with the Coronavirus at a New York City hospital. The patient remains hospitalized in serious condition.
1176	2020-03-02 23:13:19+00:00	Watching video of the dying carriage horse again, disgusted this is happening in our city. Why are these poor animals still being forced to work on the streets of America’s largest city so a few humans can profit? This needs to end. When laws condone the inhumane, change them!
1177	2020-03-02 20:59:24+00:00	"""Workers shouldn't have to choose between caring for their family and keeping their job."" — Luisa Mendes Amen. We made Paid Safe and Sick Leave the law to protect hardworking New Yorkers. Take a minute to hear her story — and Luisa, we hope you had a great first day back!"
1178	2020-03-02 20:13:00+00:00	For more information go to: http://nyc.gov/coronavirus
1179	2020-03-02 20:11:37+00:00	There is no pre-scripted timeline for this crisis. It could be with us for months. The best way to keep yourself healthy are the same steps we urge everyone to take in flu season: wash your hands often and cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.
1180	2020-03-02 20:09:19+00:00	We are also launching an early detection system with @NYCHealthy, so we can catch the first signs of the virus’ spread, and work to stop it.
1181	2020-03-02 20:07:54+00:00	We’ve received an important update since this morning. New York City’s public health lab will be able to conduct its own testing for coronavirus later today. This will help us diagnose people in hours instead of days.
1182	2020-03-02 16:18:13+00:00	We'll begin conducting our own local testing by Friday and we’re working with hospitals on early detection. We're New Yorkers — we will confront this crisis as we always do: together.
1183	2020-03-02 16:18:13+00:00	For now, this is a time to be vigilant and take commonsense precautions. Wash your hands and cover your mouth if you cough or sneeze. If you have symptoms and have a nexus to the impacted countries, contact your doctor immediately. If you don't have access to a doctor, call 311.
1184	2020-03-02 16:18:12+00:00	Doctors have our first confirmed case isolated and closely monitored. We'll provide more updates on her condition as we have them.
1185	2020-03-02 16:18:12+00:00	We know the first reported case of coronavirus has people on edge. Here's what we know about the patient: She recently traveled to Iran. She didn't use public transit after returning to NYC. She had limited contact with others. We're following up with those people.
1186	2020-03-02 15:40:45+00:00	NOBODY comes into our city and attacks our immigrant communities — that’s why our city is back in court today to fight side by side with @NewYorkStateAG James against Trump’s xenophobic public charge rule.
1187	2020-03-02 14:51:13+00:00	I’m in Manhattan with @NYGovCuomo with an update on the first confirmed case of coronavirus in New York City.
1188	2020-03-02 01:54:43+00:00	Our health authorities have been in a state of high alert for weeks, and are fully prepared to respond. We will continue to ensure New Yorkers have the facts and resources they need to protect themselves.
1189	2020-03-02 01:54:43+00:00	From the beginning, we have said it was a matter of when, not if, there would be a positive case of coronavirus in New York. Now our first case has been confirmed. The patient contracted the virus during recent travel and is isolated in her home under close monitoring.
1190	2020-03-01 18:28:34+00:00	The video of a horse collapsing and dying in Central Park yesterday is painful and says so much about a persistent problem. We’ve made real progress in animal welfare but we must go further. The NYPD’s Animal Cruelty Investigation Squad is on the case and WILL get answers.
1191	2020-02-29 21:12:56+00:00	New Yorkers won’t be divided by fear. We won’t accept discrimination in our own city. And we reject Trump’s baseless threats to shut the southern border. Lives are on the line and he’s trying to push his political agenda. It’s a disgrace.
1192	2020-02-29 18:52:20+00:00	This means we will soon, within the coming week, have the ability to get results back in a matter of hours, not days. Quick detection is vital to stopping the spread of the virus, and this development will help the experts do their job to protect New Yorkers.
1193	2020-02-29 18:52:19+00:00	Today, the FDA approved our application to develop our own test for the Coronavirus. That is not the only good news: after asking the CDC for weeks, they have finally sent us new kits that will allow us to run the CDC's test locally.
1194	2020-02-28 17:53:20+00:00	For the President of the United States to suggest the coronavirus might just be a passing thing is profoundly irresponsible.
1195	2020-02-28 17:52:44+00:00	We've gotten every conceivable warning about the coronavirus from health authorities across the country and globe. It’s been coming like a freight train and the Trump administration hasn’t even done the basics.
1196	2020-02-28 17:51:38+00:00	I have tried to stay above the fray on this crisis for five weeks. But the fact is right now Donald Trump and Mike Pence can't organize two for lunch.
1197	2020-02-28 14:58:06+00:00	We need to be able to diagnose patients in New York City if we’re going to contain this. Don’t make us fight this epidemic with one hand tied behind our back.
1198	2020-02-28 14:58:05+00:00	We’ve been fighting this battle to test locally for 5 weeks. This is a total failure of leadership by the Trump Administration and CDC.
1199	2020-02-27 23:59:34+00:00	If you or someone you know has traveled to the affected areas and are experiencing flu-like symptoms, don't hesitate — contact a doctor right away. If for any reason you can't get to a doctor, call 311 and we will help get a doctor to you.
1200	2020-02-27 23:59:01+00:00	The CDC has expanded their testing criteria to include recent travel to Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea. There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in NYC but we do currently have one potential case under investigation. We'll report those results as soon as we have them.
1201	2020-02-27 21:48:18+00:00	Atención a todos: El Censo inicia el jueves 12 de marzo y necesitamos que cada neoyorquino se haga contar. ¿Quieres saber más? ¡@AOC y @Lin_Manuel te lo contarán! #2020Census https://www1.nyc.gov/site/census/index.page
1202	2020-02-27 21:46:54+00:00	ATTENTION NEW YORK CITY: the #2020Census is coming on March 12, and we need every New Yorker to stand up and be counted. Want to learn more? @AOC and @Lin_Manuel have you covered! http://nyc.gov/census #GetCountedNYC
1203	2020-02-27 18:07:39+00:00	The NYPD is committed to protecting our schools and making sure every student gets to class safely. We will be increasing efforts in the coming days to keep our streets safe. Our kids deserve nothing less.
1204	2020-02-27 18:07:39+00:00	This is devastating. This young boy was just seven years old. It’s painful to imagine what his family is going through. Our hearts are with them today. A full investigation is underway.
1205	2020-02-27 13:23:39+00:00	We’ll never know how many people would still be alive today if the @SenateGOP had done its job and voted on the bipartisan background check bill. @MayorBarnett is right. We owe it to those lost in Milwaukee to make this bill law.
1206	2020-02-26 23:33:08+00:00	President Trump’s latest retaliation against his hometown takes away security funding from the number-one terrorist target in America — all because we refuse to play by his arbitrary rules. We’ll see him back in court and we will WIN.
1207	2020-02-26 22:31:18+00:00	February 26th, 1993. Our city endured a brutal terror attack on the World Trade Center. Tragically, it would not be the last. Today we mourn those we lost and we honor the first responders who ran into danger.
1208	2020-02-26 21:58:45+00:00	Emmett Till’s lynching was an act of terror. His murderers never truly faced justice. Today the @HouseDemocrats sent a clear, unequivocal message: this country will never hide from racism, hatred or white supremacy. We will confront them head on.
1209	2020-02-26 21:06:56+00:00	For a whole generation of New Yorkers, Eddie Byrne’s murder is seared in our memory. We will never forget it. And we’ll never forget what he stood for. We became the safest big city in America because of the sacrifices our NYPD officers make every single day.
1210	2020-02-26 20:47:53+00:00	New Yorkers don't get intimidated. We've faced any number of crises, and we'll face this one the same way: with strength and resilience. To the voices in leadership and in the media: now is not the time to sow panic. It's time to share information and help keep people safe.
1211	2020-02-26 20:47:53+00:00	To New Yorkers: if you have any flu like symptoms, go see a doctor IMMEDIATELY. If for ANY reason you can't get to a doctor, call 311 and we will get a doctor to you. Don't delay, don't explain it away. It's better to be safe than sorry.
1212	2020-02-26 20:47:53+00:00	The CDC needs to expand its screening process. We need to add the testing protocol for any traveler who has spent time in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. This will help us more effectively limit the spread.
1213	2020-02-26 20:47:53+00:00	Let me be clear: there has been an honest effort by the CDC to work with us but more can and must be done. We have lab facilities ready to help confront this crisis. They have been underutilized.
1214	2020-02-26 20:47:52+00:00	As of right now we have 1,200 hospital beds that we can make available immediately for anyone who tests positive. We also have 1.5 million surgical masks ready. We have put out a request for an additional 300,000. We will need federal government assistance to get this done.
1215	2020-02-26 20:47:52+00:00	It's been clear for weeks that it's not a question of IF the coronavirus comes to our country but WHEN. The precautions we put in place back in January have had a positive impact. As of this hour we can report NO confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New York City.
1216	2020-02-26 19:36:25+00:00	Join us at City Hall with an update on New York City's preparations for the coronavirus.
1217	2020-02-26 19:30:52+00:00	Is putting speed over safety and our cars before our kids the right thing to do? That's a NO from New York City. The bill I signed today sends a clear message: if you put your fellow New Yorkers in danger, we’re getting you OFF our roads.
1218	2020-02-26 16:55:22+00:00	If you’re a driver who puts New Yorkers in danger, then we’re taking you the hell OFF our roads. Join us at City Hall.
1219	2020-02-25 23:54:38+00:00	Join @NYCMayor and @NYCFirstLady at the @AMNH to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth!
1220	2020-02-25 23:51:39+00:00	We've been saying for weeks that it's not a matter of IF the coronavirus hits New York City but rather WHEN. We have no cases yet but the important thing for New Yorkers to know is your city is taking every necessary precaution — head to http://www.nyc.gov/health/coronavirus for more.
1221	2020-02-25 21:06:42+00:00	This is DANGEROUS. It's another one of Donald Trump's blatant political hits on New York City. The Trump Administration needs to reverse course IMMEDIATELY. New Yorkers' homes and lives are at stake here.
1222	2020-02-25 17:52:10+00:00	What a SURPRISE! The Trump administration yet again sticks it to working people to protect their CEO buddies. It's pretty simple: if you think corporate execs deserve all the power in setting workplace standards, then you're against workers.
1223	2020-02-25 14:50:36+00:00	Chancellor Carranza will be at the school to make sure we’re giving every child and teacher the support they need. A full investigation is underway. We won’t rest until the streets around every single school are safe for our kids.
1224	2020-02-25 14:49:58+00:00	Earlier this morning, a student was struck and killed by a bus while she walked to school in Brooklyn. She was just ten years old. No family should have to suffer something like this.
1225	2020-02-25 01:20:17+00:00	Firefighter Daniel Foley gave his life for our city. Just like his older brother Thomas did on 9/11. They represented the best of this city and we will never forget them. God bless their memory and their family.
1226	2020-02-24 23:01:13+00:00	We have to fix our subways. Congestion pricing will help us do it. @RealDonaldTrump is standing in the way, hurting New Yorkers and hurting his former city.
1227	2020-02-24 18:14:51+00:00	Here’s some GOOD news. Thanks to the free lawyers we’re providing tenants, evictions are WAY down! We’re fighting for tenants’ rights and keeping renters in their homes.
1228	2020-02-24 17:39:37+00:00	Finally some justice for the brave women who came forward. This is a long overdue moment of reckoning. Believe survivors. Hold abusers accountable. Change the culture.
1229	2020-02-23 19:04:10+00:00	Help is always available for our police officers. Support is just a phone call away.
1230	2020-02-23 15:02:52+00:00	Governor Murphy, New York City is behind you. Chirlane and I are praying for a swift recovery. We know you’ll beat this.
1231	2020-02-22 20:51:59+00:00	Demanding these deeply offensive works be taken off the world’s biggest digital marketplace isn’t censorship, it’s about human decency. Anti-Semitism is spreading in our society, and we must reject this hate with one clear voice.
1232	2020-02-22 19:12:05+00:00	US sanctions are NOT meant to cost innocent people their lives.
1233	2020-02-22 19:10:33+00:00	Here's a way to protect the health of people all over the world, show American leadership and goodwill, and take a big step back from the march to war: Trump should immediately offer medical assistance to Iran as it confronts coronavirus.
1234	2020-02-22 17:16:28+00:00	We hear you. All options are on the table as we look to acknowledge and preserve the history of the anti-slavery movement at 227 Duffield Street. #UndergroundRailroad #BHM
1235	2020-02-22 01:03:26+00:00	The Staten Island St. Patrick’s Day parade could make history this year and embrace the spirit of inclusion that makes our city great by having @pridecenterSI join their march and opening the parade to our LGBTQ community. I urge them to do the right thing. #StatenIslandPride
1236	2020-02-21 20:32:49+00:00	John Lewis is a tireless fighter for what’s right. He’s not afraid to make #GoodTrouble, and our students look up to him. They’ve seen the power of leadership in his life’s work, and it’s an honor to include his story in our classrooms. Happy Birthday, John.
1237	2020-02-21 18:37:07+00:00	Andy Byford tackled his job with real heart and humility. The MTA was lucky to have his leadership. On behalf of all New Yorkers, thank you Andy.
1238	2020-02-21 00:39:59+00:00	I’ve been eating at #GraysPapaya since I first moved to the city 40 years ago and it’s still one of the best deals in town.
1239	2020-02-20 22:50:15+00:00	We have real problems with @TheNCUA selling off these medallions without first working with the City. It should be EVERYONE’S priority to fight for the relief of drivers.
1240	2020-02-20 22:40:48+00:00	We've watched for decades as Washington went to the mat to protect the big banks — New York City's going to do that and more for our small businesses. #SaveOurCity https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/sotc-small-business.page
1241	2020-02-20 22:40:47+00:00	The conventional wisdom said it was IMPOSSIBLE to lower the fines that small businesses face. We've cut them 40% since 2014, and we’ll cut them another 10%. We can keep our stores safe and healthy without forcing small business owners to reach for their pocket books. #SaveOurCity
1242	2020-02-20 22:40:47+00:00	Small businesses like @sandwichshopbk are where our city’s jobs come from and where our neighborhood identities are born. They're where New Yorkers live out their dreams — but we’re losing too many of our mom-and-pop shops. That’s why we’re taking action. #SaveOurCity
1243	2020-02-20 21:49:05+00:00	This is heartbreaking news out of Queens. @NYC_Buildings has a full investigation underway. Every single worker who walks onto a job site deserves to come home safely at the end of the day.
1244	2020-02-20 20:21:11+00:00	The NYPD will also be increasing their response on trains and surrounding stations in the area to help keep ALL New Yorkers safe.
1245	2020-02-20 20:20:47+00:00	With the colder weather, we've received reports of an increased number of homeless New Yorkers along the A train. We're immediately deploying more outreach teams at stations in Upper Manhattan and nearby areas to ensure all New Yorkers are getting the help they need.
1246	2020-02-19 23:39:58+00:00	THIS is what democracy looks like! Join me and @CMKoslowitz in Forest Hills for a town hall.
1247	2020-02-19 22:16:18+00:00	The next great scientists and engineers are taking their first steps right here in our @NYCSchools — congratulations to Hunter's Ari Firester and Bronx Science's Eva Xie on being named finalists in the @Society4Science's 202 #RegeneronSTS!
1248	2020-02-19 20:12:22+00:00	10 more miles of protected bike lanes are coming to Manhattan! We're deepening our efforts to protect cyclists, make our streets safer and reach the goals of #VisionZero. Read more: https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/087-20/mayor-de-blasio-major-progress-green-wave-plan-make-streets-safer-cyclists
1249	2020-02-19 19:25:05+00:00	We CANNOT let our city become a place for only the elite. Apartments like the ones at Beach Green Dunes II in Far Rockaway are homes everyday New Yorkers can actually afford, ensuring they ALWAYS have a place in New York City.
1250	2020-02-19 18:44:22+00:00	EVERY New Yorker has the right to get where they need to go in our city. Period. If you've experienced discrimination as a Taxi or For-Hire Vehicle passenger, report it to 311.
1251	2020-02-19 16:41:54+00:00	If you're a New Yorker who's anxious about their documentation status, remember: You have rights. Call 311 and say ActionNYC for more information.
1252	2020-02-19 16:19:35+00:00	Join me in Queens to cut the ribbon on new affordable apartments that will keep New Yorkers in the city they love.
1253	2020-02-18 23:42:25+00:00	To any New Yorker who struggles with mental health issues, @NYCFirstLady's podcast has a simple message: You are not alone. If you or someone you love needs someone to talk to, call 1-888-NYC-Well or go to http://nyc.gov/nycwell.
1254	2020-02-18 23:36:57+00:00	:subscribes immediately:
1255	2020-02-18 20:52:06+00:00	We are in the midst of a BRUTAL flu season — but it's not too late to get your FREE flu shot. Call 311 today for more information.
1256	2020-02-18 20:27:19+00:00	JUST IN: we went to court to protect our Fair Workweek Law — and we WON. Predictable work schedules are a right. The finest work force in the world deserves to be able to plan their lives — and budgets. Thank you to our city's Law Department for getting this DONE.
1257	2020-02-18 17:54:42+00:00	Seniors and people with disabilities deserve reliable public transit — and now they'll have a seat at the table when decisions are made. Victor Calise and Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez are ready to fight for our riders at the MTA.
1258	2020-02-18 16:36:14+00:00	Congratulations, #KickstarterUnited! This is a HUGE win for the staff at @Kickstarter. New York City is a union town. When working people stand together, we ALL win!
1259	2020-02-17 22:21:32+00:00	To our NYPD officers: if you need someone to talk to, please reach out. Free, confidential help is standing by.
1260	2020-02-17 22:21:29+00:00	Heartbreaking news out of Queens. Please keep the family of this good man as well as his brothers and sisters in the NYPD in your thoughts tonight.
1261	2020-02-17 02:46:00+00:00	To our fellow New Yorkers who are immigrants: you have rights. Call 311 and say ActionNYC if you’re worried about your immigration status.
1262	2020-02-17 02:45:59+00:00	.@realDonaldTrump is abusing his office AGAIN. Sending Border Patrol units into our city isn’t about anyone’s safety. It’s about Trump pandering to his base in an election year.
1263	2020-02-16 14:00:26+00:00	Finally, it was my honor to meet with @RepYvetteClarke and thank her for holding the line for our city in Washington.
1264	2020-02-16 14:00:24+00:00	These are tomorrow’s leaders but they’re not waiting for their turn — they’re seizing the moment and making themselves heard.
1265	2020-02-16 14:00:23+00:00	One of the best things about caucus weekend in Albany is the young people coming out in force to make their voices heard. Senator @jamaaltbailey’s youth summit was VERY inspiring.
1266	2020-02-16 14:00:21+00:00	In 6 years as mayor, I’ve never seen a session that Families for Safe Streets weren’t walking the halls in Albany to make this city even safer. Thank you for all you do.
1267	2020-02-16 14:00:19+00:00	VERY productive day in Albany yesterday. Working side by side with Assembly Members @MrMikeBlake, @Fernandez4NY and @WalterTMosley as well as Senators @NYSenBenjamin, @RJackson_NYC, @SenatorPersaud and @LuisSepulvedaNY I’m confident we can fight back against cuts to Medicaid.
1268	2020-02-15 22:29:10+00:00	This is OUTRAGEOUS. Let me be perfectly clear: there WILL be consequences for anyone caught taking part in this kind of cruel racial profiling. To our Asian American community: your city has your back and this discrimination will NOT be tolerated.
1269	2020-02-15 20:19:29+00:00	New York State needs a budget that puts working families FIRST. Today I met with Assembly Member @Fernandez4NY and Senators @jamaaltbailey, @RJackson_NYC and @LuisSepulvedaNY to discuss how our city will fight back against Medicaid and education cuts.
1270	2020-02-15 01:06:29+00:00	If you or someone you love is anxious about their documentation status, remember: you have rights. Call 311 and say ActionNYC. We’ve added staffing to have experts on hand to help 24/7.
1271	2020-02-15 01:04:53+00:00	Sending SWAT teams trained for rural border areas into our densely-populated streets is a formula for disaster that won't make our city any safer. But this stunt isn't about keeping people safe, it's Trump's desperate attempt to get re-elected.
